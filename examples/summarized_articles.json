    "ai_summary": "The Lebanese army has significantly increased its presence along the border with Israel, deploying nearly 10,000 troops and dismantling Hezbollah posts in the aftermath of the Israel-Hezbollah war that ended with a ceasefire in November 2024. The army has closed 11 smuggling routes along the Litani River and discovered numerous weapons and tunnels previously used by Hezbollah, while also facing ongoing Israeli airstrikes. Despite the Lebanese government's support for a U.S.-backed disarmament plan, Hezbollah has rejected the initiative, asserting that it will not disarm until Israel ceases its attacks and withdraws from occupied territories."
