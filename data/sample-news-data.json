            "content": "ZIBQIN VALLEY, Lebanon (AP) — The Lebanese army has intensified its efforts in areas along the border with Israel, in the volatile area that witnessed the 14-month war between Israel and the Hezbollah militant group. Parts of the zone south of the Litani River and north of the border with Israel were formerly a Hezbollah stronghold, off limits to the Lebanese national army and U.N. peacekeepers deployed in the area. But since a ceasefire ended the Israel-Hezbollah war a year ago, Lebanon’s army has boosted its presence along the border to nearly 10,000 troops, closed 11 crossing points used for smuggling along the Litani River, and is dealing with huge amounts of unexploded ordnance, according to several senior army officers. The army took dozens of journalists from local and and international media outlets Friday on a tour of the rugged area along the border. Its troops could be seen in places where Hezbollah once had a heavy military presence. Israel has carried out almost daily airstrikes since the November 2024 ceasefire, mainly targeting Hezbollah members but 127 civilians have also been killed, according to the office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights. Hezbollah has only claimed responsibility for an attack on an Israeli military post since last November. The group maintains it no longer has an armed presence south of the Litani River, close to the border. Hezbollah rejected disarmament plan Hezbollah refuses to discuss full disarmament across Lebanon until Israel stops its attacks and withdraws from five hilltop points that it captured during the war and still holds. The latest Israel-Hezbollah war began Oct. 8, 2023, a day after Hamas attacked southern Israel, after Hezbollah fired rockets into Israel in solidarity with Hamas. Israel launched a widespread bombardment of Lebanon for two months last year that severely weakened Hezbollah, followed by a ground invasion. In August, the Lebanese government voted in favor of a U.S.-backed plan to disarm Hezbollah. Hezbollah rejected the plan. In recent weeks, Israel has said that Hezbollah is working on rebuilding its capabilities in south Lebanon. “The Lebanese army is making tremendous efforts during this critical period in the history of the region,” said Brig. Gen. Nicolas Thabet, Lebanese army commander in the sector south of the Litani River. The journalists were taken Friday to Zibqin Valley, where Hezbollah once had rocket launchers, tunnels and posts hidden in the bushy region. There was no presence of the militant group and its former posts were either struck or now controlled by Lebanese troops. A nearly 100-meter (328 feet) tunnel inside a mountain, used by Hezbollah in the past, contained what appeared to be a small medical clinic, a ventilation system, power cables, water tankers and large amounts of canned food. Zibqin Valley is where munitions in an arms depot exploded in August, killing six army experts who were dismantling them. “We will not abandon our goals no matter what the difficulties are,” said Thabet, adding that “the army is making major sacrifices” in one of “the most dangerous parts of the Middle East.” Weapons and tunnels discovered Army officers told journalists that there have been 5,198 violations by Israel since the ceasefire, including 657 airstrikes. They added that 13,981 housing units were destroyed by the war, in addition to the damage done to infrastructure in border villages. They said that some of the weapons and ordnance they found were dismantled or ,detonated while others have been put in storage. Weapons that can be used are taken by the army, they said. The officers added that the army now has 200 posts south of Litani River, in addition to 29 fixed checkpoints, and it operates patrols around the clock. On Sept. 5, the army strengthened its efforts in the region after the government’s decision to disarm Hezbollah. Since then, troops have discovered 74 tunnels, 175 rocket launchers and 58 missiles. Thabet said the army does not enter homes to search them without a judicial order and only do so if they witness illegal activities as they’re taking place.",

            "content": "BASSETERRE: The St. Kitts and Nevis Senior Women’s National Team battled to a dramatic 2-2 draw against Cuba on Tuesday in their second Concacaf W Qualifiers Group E match. Forward Phoenetia Browne continued her excellent form, opening the scoring in the first half with a brilliant finish to give the Sugar Girlz an early advantage. Cuba responded in the second half, scoring twice to take a 2-1 lead and seemingly securing all three points. However, the Sugar Girlz received an unlikely equalizer when Cuba scored an own goal, bringing St. Kitts and Nevis level at 2-2. The St. Kitts and Nevis Football Association described the result as “a hard-fought point on the road and a performance to be proud of.” The draw represents an important result for Head Coach Earl Jones’ side after their opening 2-1 loss to Aruba. The team demonstrated resilience by coming from behind to salvage a point away from home. Browne has now scored in both of St. Kitts and Nevis’ opening Group E matches, establishing herself as a key attacking threat in the qualification campaign. The Sugar Girlz will resume their qualifying campaign in March 2026, when they continue their pursuit of a top finish in Group E. The group winner advances to the 2026 Concacaf W Championship, which serves as the qualifier for the FIFA Women’s World Cup Brazil 2027 and LA 2028 Summer Olympics. St. Kitts and Nevis currently has one point from two matches.",

            "content": "Parents will be able to use gift vouchers and supermarket loyalty points to buy infant formula under a government plan to make baby milk more affordable. Under the new measures, parents will be given clearer guidance on the nutritional standards, which need to be met by all formula sold in the UK, and encourage retailers to provide the same. The scheme is aimed at giving families confidence to choose cheaper options. Officials estimate those who cannot or choose not to breastfeed could save up to £500 a year. The price of infant formula has increased dramatically in recent years, with a standard tin costing between £12 and £15. Charities were concerned that lower income families were watering down the formula or struggling to pay for other essentials because of the high cost. Some retailers had previously highlighted that rules prohibiting the direct or indirect advertising of infant formula made it impossible for them to discount it, and were unsure if people could use loyalty schemes to buy their milk. Just three companies make up about 90% of the infant formula market: Danone, Kendal, and Nestle. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) looked at the sector earlier in the year, and recommended that it should be made much clearer to parents that all products on the shelves meet nutritional standards, so families were not pressured into buying higher cost brands for fear of making sure their baby got the best start. Announcing the changes in Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, Sir Keir Starmer said parents had for too long \"been pushed into spending more on infant formula than neededWe will take action to give parents and carers the confidence to access infant formula at more affordable prices. with clearer guidance for retailers and by helping new parents use loyalty points and vouchers,\" he said. Health Secretary Wes Streeting said it was \"not right\" that manufacturers had been able to package their products in such a way to play on concerns new parents have for what is best for their baby. \"These new measures mean parents will have confidence in the formula they are buying, no matter the price, and can now make the most of supermarket loyalty schemes too,\" he said. Other recommendations from the CMA, which the government has agreed to adopt in principle, include ensuring all infant formula is displayed together, separate from other formula milks, and to clarify what counts as advertising. The government said further action was needed on other recommendations, including the prohibition of non-verifiable messages on infant and follow-on formula labels, and extending the restriction on advertising for follow-on formula. A CMA spokesperson said the watchdog was ready to support governments and agencies across the UK in either implementing its recommendations or advising on measures that remained under consideration. The authorities in all four devolved nations have agreed to the government's response.",

            "content": "Chile has officially banned the use of mobile phones and other smart devices in elementary and middle school classrooms, a move set to take effect next year. The South American nation becomes the latest to impose such restrictions on young students, aiming to mitigate the detrimental effects of smartphone use and reduce classroom distractions. The step aligns Chile with other countries, including France, Brazil, Hungary, the Netherlands, and China, which have implemented various levels of smartphone restrictions in schools. Education Minister Nicolás Cataldo hailed the decision on social media, saying: \"We are advancing a cultural change for children and adolescents who today, more than ever, need to see each other’s faces again, socialize during recess, and regain concentration to further boost learning.\" The ban, initially approved in principle by the Senate earlier this year, saw its final amendments passed by a vote in Chile's lower house of Congress late Tuesday. After a debate, lawmakers overwhelmingly endorsed the updated legislation banning smartphone use during class hours, except during emergencies and for educational and other purposes specified under the law. The bill must be signed by President Gabriel Boric before taking effect nationwide at the start of the 2026 school year. In response to rising concerns about young people and their mental health, parents and teachers in Chile have lobbied for such a law for years, arguing that the use of smartphones impairs students’ learning and emotional development. A school in the capital, Santiago, this year launched a successful pilot program that blocks cellphone signals. More than half of all Chilean students reported digital devices disrupting their learning, according to the most recent international study by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, which evaluates student academic performance. Phone ban has ‘potential benefits’ A study in the UK said a phone ban offers “potential benefits” for school performance and pupil attainment, as well as children’s wellbeing. An analysis which looked at the responses from 162 secondary schools in England suggested a “clear correlation” between an effective phone ban and better school performance. Children at schools with an effective ban achieved exam results that were one to two grades higher compared with children at schools with “laxer policies”, the study suggested. Secondary schools with an effective ban were more than twice as likely to be rated outstanding by the school regulator as the national average.",

            "content": "One man’s trash is another man’s ticket to $1 million. A lucky 33‑year-old man from Michigan turned a simple impulse purchase into a life‑changing win, all because someone else passed on a lottery ticket. The anonymous player bought a $10 ticket from the instant‑game Blazing Suits at the Fawaz Petroleum LLC, located at 19245 Schoolcraft Road in Detroit. “There was a Blazing Suits ticket set aside on the counter that someone else had decided not to purchase, so I purchased it,” the unnamed man told the Michigan Lottery. “I scratched the ticket off and couldn’t believe it when I saw it was a $1 million winner! I never would have thought I’d win such a large lottery prize, so it’s truly a blessing.” When claiming the prize at Lottery headquarters, the man opted for a one‑time lump‑sum payment of about $693,000, rather than receiving the full amount over time. He said he plans to save the jackpot. “Winning is a great feeling, but it’s also a lot of pressure because your mind starts thinking of all the different things you can do with this amount of money,” the man said. Officials with the Michigan Lottery, including Commissioner Suzanna Shkreli, congratulated the winner and noted that games such as Blazing Suits help fund Michigan schools. “In Fiscal Year 2025, the Lottery contributed more than $1 billion to the School Aid Fund for the seventh consecutive year,” Shkreli said in a statement. Since its launch in June, Blazing Suits has awarded over $14 million in prizes statewide. The $10 tickets offer a top prize of $1 million, with over $32 million in total prizes still available, including two more $1 million top prizes and 15 $2,000 prizes. In 2024, Michigan players won almost $1. 8 billion from instant lottery games.",

            "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) President Donald Trump pardoned Texas Democratic Rep. Henry Cuellar and his wife in a federal bribery and conspiracy case on Wednesday, citing what he called a “weaponized” justice system. Trump, who has argued that his own legal troubles were a partisan witch hunt, said on social media without presenting evidence that Cuellar and his wife, Imelda Cuellar, were prosecuted because the congressman had been critical of President Joe Biden’s immigration policies. Trump, a Republican, said in a social media post that Cuellar “bravely spoke out against Open Borders” and accused Biden, a Democrat, of going after the congressman and his wife “simply for speaking the TRUTH.” Federal authorities had charged Cuellar and his wife with accepting thousands of dollars in exchange for the congressman advancing the interests of an Azerbaijan-controlled energy company and a bank in Mexico. Cuellar is accused of agreeing to influence legislation favorable to Azerbaijan and deliver a pro-Azerbaijan speech on the floor of the U. S. House. Cuellar has said he and his wife are innocent. The couple’s trial had been set to begin next April. “Henry, I don’t know you, but you can sleep well tonight,” Trump wrote in his social media post announcing the pardon. “Your nightmare is finally over!” Cuellar, who has served in Congress for more than 20 years, is a moderate Democrat who represents an area on the Texas-Mexico border and has a history of breaking with his party when it comes to immigration and firearms. He was among the most vocal critics of the Biden administration’s response to a record number of migrants crossing the U. S.-Mexico border. He also is one of the last Democrats in Congress who opposes abortion rights. Cuellar is not the only Democrat Trump has pardoned this year. In February, he pardoned former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich, five years after he had commuted his sentence in a political corruption case. Like in Cuellar’s case, Trump suggested that New York City Mayor Eric Adams, a Democrat, faced federal corruption charges because he made comments critical of Biden’s immigration policies. Trump did not pardon Adams, but after Trump took office, the Justice Department moved to drop the case against the mayor, who had begun working with the Republican administration on immigration issues. A top Justice Department official, who was also Trump’s defense lawyer in several of his cases, stepped in to seek dismissal in the case. ( ).",

            "creator": "Zee News",
            "content": "New Delhi: A few days before Russian President Vladimir Putin’s scheduled arrival in India, a controversy erupted over a joint article written by German and French ambassadors along with the British high commissioner. Published Titled ‘The world wants the Ukraine war to end, but Russia does not seem serious about peace’, the op-ed, which was authored by German Ambassador Philipp Ackermann, French Ambassador Thierry Mathou and British High Commissioner Lindy Cameron, immediately caught attention. The opening lines itself set tone of the article. The three diplomats wrote that for more than three years, the people of Ukraine have defended their country with courage and deep resolve. “Russia can end this war immediately by withdrawing its forces and stopping its illegal aggression, or at the very least by agreeing to a ceasefire, entering negotiations and bringing the fighting to a close,” they wrote. They added, “But in 2025, Russian attacks have intensified, and since peace talks began, President Putin has launched 22 of the largest strikes of the entire war.” Throughout their piece, Russia was repeatedly described as the principal driver of the continuing conflict. Referring to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, they highlighted a statement he had made earlier, “The world agrees that the war must stop. India has also made this clear. Prime Minister Modi has said that no solution can be found on the battlefield.” Meanwhile, India has expressed displeasure over the joint op-ed, with the Ministry of External Affairs terming it “unusual” and “not acceptable”. Question On Timing, Intent Without leaving any room for ambiguity, Kanwal Sibal, who has served as the foreign secretary and ambassador to Russia, bluntly cricised the article and described it as a “breach of diplomatic norms” and a “diplomatic insult to India”. “This vicious article against Russia just before Putin’s state visit to India breaches diplomatic norms, is a diplomatic insult to India as it questions India’s close ties with a very friendly third country,” he wrote on X (formerly Twitter). He went on to write, “It is interference in our internal affairs as the purpose is to fuel anti- Russian sentiments in pro- European circles in India and question the morality of our ties with Russia. The envoys of these three countries are free to make their views known to the MEA in an official demarche but are not supposed to engage in public grandstanding with an overt propagandist intent.” He did not spare the newspaper either. He said that it was “entirely wrong of TOI to accept to publish this article. This is consciously doing dis-service to our diplomacy and national interest. MEA should express its displeasure publicly at this violation of diplomatic norms by the three envoys”. Sibal also expressed displeasure after ANI interviewed the German ambassador during the build-up to Putin’s visit. “It is difficult to understand why ANI made a special effort to give the German Ambassador a platform to voice anti-Russia statements right before Putin’s visit. The mindset of our press at times resembles that of a banana republic,” he posted. He added, “The German Ambassador does not need to tell our leaders what to say to Putin. We oppose the war in Ukraine, but we also know Europe seeks peace only through military power. The envoy should instead be asked why Germany continues to provide weapons and financial aid to Ukraine, and why, despite the atrocities committed by Nazi Germany against Russia in the past, it is again on a confrontational path with Russia.” Media Choices Under Scrutiny The criticism did not stop there. Sriymoy Talukdar, a senior editor at Firstpost, argued that the article should never have appeared in an Indian publication at such a sensitive moment. “This article should not have been published in any Indian media outlet at the time of Putin’s visit. It is a clear attempt to interfere in India’s foreign policy and seems written with the intention of embarrassing India ahead of the Russian President’s arrival,” he wrote. According to him, “India is not a platform for Europe’s moral rhetoric against Russia. The article is extremely poor in taste and so is the decision by an Indian publication to give it space.” His criticism prompted a swift response from Suhasini Haidar, diplomatic affairs editor at The Hindu. “Why is the media being targeted here? It is for the Ministry of External Affairs to decide whether a protocol has been violated or not,” he countered the criticism. ‘Not A Protocol Breach, But In Good Taste’ Ranjit Rae, former ambassador to Nepal and Vietnam, offered a more measured view when asked by the BBC whether the article amounted to a breach of diplomatic protocol. “I don’t think there is any violation of protocol, but it is true that when an important guest is arriving, saying such things right before the visit does not go down well. It won’t be considered in good taste. Europe has issues with Russia, but Europe’s problems do not automatically become the world’s problems. Even then, in a democratic country, there should be space to welcome and to criticise,” he said. Another diplomat who previously served as India’s Ambassador to France, speaking to BBC on condition of anonymity, echoed Rae’s sentiment. “This is not a protocol violation, but certainly not in good taste. Think of it this way: if I were India’s ambassador in the United States and Pakistan’s prime minister arrived with his Army chief, our government would want some negative atmosphere around them. We might try using the local press. If a paper agreed to give space, we would write something. The second question is whether, in Putin’s case, Indian media should have offered space to European diplomats.” Geopolitical Signal Behind Putin’s Visit Strategic affairs expert Brahma Chellaney believes the timing of Putin’s trip carries a much deeper message to the world. “In a world dividing into rival blocs, President Putin’s December 4-5 visit to New Delhi is not an ordinary diplomatic stop; it is a powerful geopolitical signal. This visit could lead to important agreements, including new payment channels. It is crucial for efforts to bypass the SWIFT system and reduce the dominance of the U. S. dollar,” he posted on X. He added, “India has watched how Western policies, through sanctions and the weaponisation of financial tools beyond SWIFT, have pushed Russia deeper into China’s embrace. Even then, Putin’s visit, his first since the Ukraine war began, shows that Russia still sees options beyond China and does not intend to become a ‘junior partner’.” ‘Europe’s Problems Are Not World’s Problems’ Chellaney also pointed out that India is sending its own message. “At a time when the U. S., under Trump’s leadership, is treating India disrespectfully, New Delhi is neither isolating Russia nor following Western sanctions that restrict its strategic autonomy. By hosting Putin, India is making it clear that it rejects the Western idea of ‘either you are with us or against us’ and will choose its own path,” he wrote. This theme has appeared in Indian foreign policy discourse before. In June 2022, External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar said at a conference in Bratislava, “Europe has grown up with the mindset that its problems are the world’s problems, but the world’s problems are not Europe’s problems.” Later, Jindal Global Law School Professor Prabhash Ranjan connected Jaishankar’s remark to a historic speech by Jawaharlal Nehru at the United Nations General Assembly on November 3, 1948. Nehru had said, “I am equally interested in solving Europe’s problems. But I also want to say that the world extends beyond Europe. You cannot solve your problems with the belief that Europe’s problems are the world’s main problems. The conversation must be holistic. If you ignore even one part of the world’s issues, you are not truly understanding them. I speak here as a representative of Asia, which is very much a part of this world.” Germany’s then Chancellor Olaf Scholz would later cite Jaishankar’s remark during the Munich Security Conference in February 2023, saying, “The Indian foreign minister has a point. But it will not remain only Europe’s problem if rules in international relations are not enforced strictly.”.",

            "content": "Homeowners and contractors in Mississauga could soon face fines for allowing construction dust to drift onto neighbouring properties. The recommendation passed by city council was unanimously approved, introducing a $305 administrative penalty that will take effect March 2, 2026. The changes introduced on Dec. 3 will update a decades-old bylaw to specifically target dust from residential construction. The updated rules apply only to residential construction activities and do not cover multi-residential, commercial or industrial projects. Municipal work and permitted residential demolitions are also exempt. The move comes as the city looks to modernize its 1985 Debris and Anti-Littering By-law, which until now had no direct provisions to deal with dust from activities such as concrete cutting. According to a staff report, dust complaints have been rising and can pose health, environmental and quality-of-life concerns for nearby residents. Under the new rules, property owners, contractors or managers will be responsible for preventing dust from escaping their site. Recommendations of measures to prevent excessive dust include wetting materials, using wet or dustless saws, installing tarps or wind fencing and using vacuum attachments. Trending Now ICE taps Canadian firm for 20 armoured vehicles despite Trump trade war Canada’s federal income tax brackets are changing in 2026 According to the report, if a bylaw officer confirms a violation, they will be able to issue an order, which could include the $305 penalty or a Provincial Offence Act charge. The fine may increase if a second or third offence is committed. More serious cases could result in fines of up to $100,000 upon conviction. Mississauga modelled its changes on Toronto’s dust-control bylaw, which staff say is the most comprehensive in the region. Brampton and Oakville also have dust-related nuisance rules, with fines starting at $300.",

            "content": "Unions 'fight back' against school dinner price hike Just now Michael FitzpatrickBBC News NI Trade unions have taken part in a protest against an increase in the price of school dinners and other savings plans announced by the Education Authority (EA). The rally, at Stormont, was organised by NIPSA, Unite, GMB and Unison. Last month the EA said the cost of a school dinner for primary and special school pupils will go up by 50p from £2. 60 to £3. 10. The price rises will take effect from January 2026. The deputy general secretary of NIPSA, Patrick Mullholland said the unions were determined to \"fight back\" against the EA's plans. \"The Education Authority has brought forward a package of cuts for education services this year, those cuts are unachievable in our view, but they are also extremely damaging if the Education Department actually tries to implement them. \"Our point to the EA, is that they need to set a budget that is based on people's needs, that means it will have to be an overspend budgetWe have to reach the point where the decisions of the Northern Ireland Assembly are based on the needs of the people, rather than directives from Westminster.\" 'Completely irresponsible' Kellie Turtle, policy officer, from the Unison trade union said the increase to the school meal cost is \"completely irresponsibleIt's placing the burden of the funding gap in education on to children, on to families, many of whom are already struggling to pay. \"The cuts that have been proposed do seem to disproportionately impact children who may already be marginalised with our education system. \"For example some of the cuts to EOTAS services and transport services will have a disproportionate impact on children with special educational needs.\" 'Vulnerable children suffer the most' Jim Donley from the GMB trade union said the EA needed the \"appropriate funding\" from the Executive. \"When all the cuts come, it's usually the vulnerable children that suffer the most. \"We need an education system that is fit for purpose and it needs to be properly funded from the Executive.\" When the cost of school meals went up the EA said that the cost of a school dinner had not risen since 2017/18 while inflation had increased by around 35% in that time. They said that each school meal costs an average of £4. 28 to produce. The EA has said it is facing a funding gap of £300m and, unlike in previous years, does not expect additional in-year money to address the shortfall.",

            "content": "NEWYou can now listen to Fox News articles! Late last month, when former Afghan commando fighter Rahmanullah Lakanwal vanished without warning from his home in Bellingham, Wash., his wife, Khamila, called his phone, trying to learn where he had gone, according to people familiar with the matter. \"Where are you?\" she asked in one call, speaking in their native language of Pashto, according to people briefed on the communications. He told her, \"I’m busy with some friends.\" Hours later, she called again. This time, he allegedly answered differently. FOUR YEARS AFTER ABBEY GATE, VETERANS WHO SAVED CIVILIANS DEMAND ACCOUNTABILITY \"I’m with Tablighis.\" He continued, \"I’m doing Tabligh,\" according to sources.. To his wife, the word \"Tablighi\" had immediate meaning, family contacts said, setting off alarm bells that she shared with Lakanwal’s older brother, Ismail Khosti. In Afghanistan, surnames may vary among family members as they choose different tribal or geographical affiliations. The family is from Lakan district in Khost province. Tablighi is an Arabic word that means to \"inform\" or \"convey\" and it refers today to Tablighi Jamaat, a global Islamic missionary movement established in 1926 in British India as a revivalist wing of the strict Deobandi religious school of thought that today fuels the tyrannical interpretation of Islam practiced by the Afghan Taliban and Pakistani militant groups. Much like its sister group, the Muslim Brotherhood, established in 1928, and other Muslim groups preaching the extremist Wahhabi and Salafi interpretations of Islam, counterterrorism experts say it acts like a conveyor belt to extremism. Based in Pakistan and India, Tablighi Jamaat’s influence is transnational, with networks operating in mosques and informal religious circles in at least 150 countries, including the U. S. It denounces terrorism publicly, but a report, \"Tablighi Jamaat and Its Role in the Global Jihad,\" by Brussels-based think tank the South Asia Democratic Forum warned the group serves as a \"catalyst, gateway, springboard or antechamber\" for Islamic radicalization. Several Muslim nations, including Saudi Arabia, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Iran, have banned Tabligi Jamaat, along with Russia, which disbanded a terror cell in 2020. In 2021, Saudi Arabia called the group a \"danger to society.\" In the U. S., its missionaries operate freely. Fox New Digital has learned that Lakanwal’s brother has shared details from the phone calls, previously unreported, with FBI agents. Now, FBI and Department of Homeland Security investigators are scouring the country to see if anyone tied to the Tablighi Jamaat network radicalized Lakanwal, facilitated his cross-country trip or offered assistance, encouragement or financial support for his Thanksgiving eve ambush of West Virginia National Guard service members Sarah Beckstrom, 20, and Andrew Wolfe, 24, as they quietly patrolled 17th Street NW, near the White House. Beckstrom died from her injuries. Wolfe remains critically injured. TRUMP ADMIN 'ACTIVELY RE-EXAMINING ALL OF THE AFGHANS IMPORTED INTO THE COUNTRY' FOLLOWING DC SHOOTING On Sunday, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem hinted at this new information, saying on NBC’s \"Meet the Press, We believe he was radicalized since he’s been here in this country. We do believe it was through connections in his home community and state.\" Amid reports that Lakanwal was isolated, depressed and psychologically distressed, counterterrorism experts said the new details add a critical dimension to the investigation, noting that untreated trauma, isolation and grievances can create psychological conditions for extremist ideology to gain a foothold, creating \"wound collectors,\" a term that retired FBI special agent Joe Navarro coined to describe extremists, from Usama bin Laden to \"Unabomber\" Ted Kaczynski, who use perceived injustices to justify violence with \"no statute of limitations on their suffering.\" Flashback: Tablighi to American Taliban While Tablighi Jamaat’s leaders say their movement is apolitical, focused on dawah, an Arabic word for evangelizing or proselytizing, counterterrorism experts have said the movement’s insular missionary culture has appeared along the early radicalization paths of some extremists, including \"American Taliban\" John Walker Lindh, a convert to Islam who attended Tablighi Jamaat retreats in northern California in the 1990s, including at the Santa Clara County fairgrounds. After U. S. forces dropped bombs in Afghanistan after the 9/11 attacks, CIA paramilitary officers captured Lindh in a prison near Mazar-i-Sharif, Afghanistan, among imprisoned Taliban militants who revolted, overpowering guards and killing CIA paramilitary officer Mike Spann, the first U. S. casualty of the war. Convicted in 2002 for serving as a soldier for the Taliban, Lindh was freed from jail in 2019 and is free on probation in the U. S. today, tracked by the FBI. While the Trump administration issued an executive order last month to designate some of Muslim Brotherhood’s chapters as terrorist organizations, Tabligi Jamaat hasn’t been on its radar for action. ALLEGED DC SHOOTER ENTERED US UNDER AFGHAN RESETTLEMENT PUSH MAYORKAS VOWED WOULD BE DONE ‘SWIFTLY AND SAFELY' Ironically, Deobandi Islam is the religious ideology of the Taliban fighters that Lakanwal and his brother battled for years as members of the \"Zero Units,\" covert forces within the Afghanistan’s intelligence service, the National Directorate of Security, funded, trained and supported by the CIA’s secret \"Special Activities Division\" to fight the Taliban. While these Afghan fighters battled extremist interpretations of Islam in Afghanistan over the past 24 years, following the 9/11 attacks, counterterrorism experts note that organizations and mosques established by followers of the Muslim Brotherhood and Tablighi Jamaat have spread worldwide. Tablighi Jamaat representatives in Pakistan and India didn’t respond to multiple requests for comment. A Brother’s Shame The irony is not lost on Lakanwal’s brother, Khosti, a former company commander in NDS-03, known as the Kandahar Strike Force, where his brother worked as a paramilitary officer, former colleagues said. Over the past several days, he has told former Afghan military and intelligence veterans that he is \"ashamed\" of his brother’s murderous rampage and he wants the full truth to emerge of how he ended up on 17th Street NW, turning his weapon on the very troops he had spent years protecting. Literally translated, Lakanwal’s brother said, \"This was a wrong action,\" using the Pashto word ghalat to describe something that is wrong to do. He told his former colleagues, \"I am ashamed of this action,\" using the word sharmezham, a derivative of the Pashto word for shame, a powerful dynamic in the honor culture of Pashtunwali in which many of the men grew up. ABBEY GATE GOLD STAR FATHER BLISTERS BIDEN AFTER AFGHAN NATIONAL ALLEGEDLY AMBUSHES 2 NATIONAL GUARDSMEN IN DC Afghan Lt. Gen. Haibatullah Alizai, 40, the final commander of the National Defense and Security Forces after the president and defense minister fled Afghanistan in mid-August 2021, told Fox News Digital that he was sickened by the news of the attack and solving the mystery of Lakanwal’s path to extremism is now a personal quest. \"It’s a serious question how Rahmanullah Lakanwal became radicalized in the United States,\" Alizai said. \"I feel responsibility for this. I was overall commander of the Afghan armed forces. We must get to the bottom of this because we cannot allow this kind of violence in America or anywhere. We fought Islamic extremism every day against the Taliban. It is our duty as Afghans to help America get justice.\" It’s understood Lakanwal’s wife has since moved with her five sons into the home of her brother-in-law and sister-in-law in the San Diego area. Countering social media rumors, Lakanwal’s brother also told former colleagues that his only other brother, Mohammed Rasul Khan, is not working for the terrorist Haqqani network and died of a heart attack in 2021 in Dubai. Now, as federal investigators zero in on Lakanwal’s final words to his wife about being with the \"Tablighi,\" they are examining his life in the U. S. over the past four years. In recent days, media reports have pointed to two emails shared by a volunteer caseworker working with Laknawal to highlight possible psychological issues Lakanwal might have faced, including post-traumatic stress disorder and depression. After receiving the two emails from the case worker, Shawn VanDiver, president of a nonprofit, Afghan Evac, said he shared them with journalists to highlight unmet needs among Afghan military and intelligence veterans who worked beside U. S. forces. HOMELAND SECURITY COMMITTEE SAYS 'NATIONAL SECURITY BLUNDERS' OF PAST 4 YEARS HAVE EMBOLDENED TERRORISTS Secretive ‘Manic’ Road Trips The emails, shared with Fox News Digital on condition they not be published fully, reveal something else: eight references to \"manic\" road trips and periods when Lakanwal vanished for days with little communication. While investigators haven’t yet established a direct link between the travel and any religious activity, analysts note that Tablighi work requires men to take small-group mission trips, called khuruj, lasting from a few days to several months, to mosques and communities. According to the emails, after U. S. forces flew Afghan fighters from the \"Zero Units\" out on Aug. 15, 2021, Lakanwal and his family were moved to the furthest corner of the continental U. S. in Bellingham, a small seaside town, in January 2022. By March 2023, a volunteer case manager wrote in the emails that Lakanwal had lost his job, and he started engaging in \"reckless travel, manic\" bursts, where \"he will take off in the family car and drive non stop to A. Chicago B. Arizona this time.\" In an email on Jan. 11, 2024, she lamented, \"My Afghan families, now in WA almost two vears are not thriving.\" She added, \"No matter how many Pashto interpreters we use, and interventions, they are steering their families in ways that in the USA will lead to catastrophe.’ She noted, \"They have 3 of us White, American women volunteers trying to patch benefits together and chase [Department of Social and Human Services] requirements and English classes that none of them attend.\" Overwhelmed, she wondered, \"Perhaps is there a Pashto speaking Afghan male leader or advisor or resource that we can bring to these men to help them collectively and individually make better choices for their families ?\" ALINA HABBA BLASTS BIDEN IMMIGRATION POLICIES AS ‘ABSOLUTE FAILURE’ AFTER DEADLY NATIONAL GUARD AMBUSH By Jan. 31, 2024, the caseworker wrote a series of bullet points, including this: \"He drives day and night, and sends map pins to one of the volunteer sponsors, and we can grab photos from Instagram stories, but no other communication. His family generally does not know where he is or when he will be back.\" She added, \"As far as we can tell, these trips are not for any productive purpose.\" She said he paid for gas with the EBT stipend he received from the government. She continued: \"The last time he came home from a trip, (chicago) he demanded that his wife divorce him, (in front of sponsors who witnessed this).\" He apparently deployed a Thabligi interpretation of Islam that says husbands can say, \"I divorce you,\" three times to end a marriage. Her last bullet point was: \"Right now, since he is off on a manic trip that has taken him from Bellingham to Phoenix to Indianapolis, his wife, Khamila, has been home with the boys in a period of relative stability.\" Khosti now tells Afghan friends that he wonders how his brother financed the 2, 800-mile one-way trip from Bellingham to Washington, D. C., and how he obtained a firearm. A Company Commander’s Grief VETERANS GROUPS URGE TRUMP ADMIN TO CONTINUE AFGHAN ALLY SUPPORT PROGRAM AMID BUDGET CUT CONCERNS When Lakanwal’s company commander, Mohammad Iqbal Selanee, learned the news of the shooting, he was on the job as a janitor in a San Diego-area hotel. He wasn’t embarking on life-or-death missions, like he’d been doing beside U. S. forces in Afghanistan, but he was grateful to America for the gift of a new, safe start for his family. Looking at the photos of the National Guard soldiers shot by Lakanwal, he said he recalled the faces of U. S. servicemembers he’d fought beside. He also thought of his daughter, 11, as he focused on the image of Beckstrom, the young woman from West Virginia murdered. Spread across the U. S. at far-flung posts, he was hundreds of miles away from Lakanwal as his former charge had fled his home for secret road trips. Now, he has spent the past several days piecing together Lakanwal’s alleged descent in the U. S. into a new army of zealotry with the Tablighi Jamaat. \"He’s been with Tablighi Jamaat,\" in the U. S., he said. \"He isolated himself. He was away from his friends and family. Some people hurt themselves. He hurt the whole nation. I’m not a commander anymore in the military, but as a human being, this is my responsibility to uncover what happened to Rahmanullah, for the safety of everyone. This is a big tragedy. For 20 years, we have fought beside Americans like brothers, and Rahmanullah betrayed that friendship. It is inhumane what he did.\" Lakanwal attended the Bellingham Masjid, operated by the Islamic Center of Whatcom County, blocks from his apartment, mosque officials confirmed. In a statement issued on Saturday, mosque officials said Lakanwal was \"not an integrated part of our community.\" ‘A Cover for Jihadists’ For Ismail Royer, this investigation hits home on another level. A convert to Islam, Royer went to Pakistan in the 1990s after embracing an extremist interpretation of Islam and joined the Lashkar-e-Taiba terrorist group. He later pleaded guilty to weapons charges related to violating U. S. neutrality laws and served 14 years in a maximum security prison. While behind bars, he crossed paths with Muslims convicted of terrorism charges, including Richard Reid, who tried to blow up a plane over the Atlantic by lighting explosives in his shoe, and Lindh, the \"American Taliban.\" Working now to counter extremism, Royer said Tablighi Jamaat can serve \"as a cover for jihadists\" and it can be \"a waystation, a stage in the path of someone from irreligious to religious,\" and then, sometimes, violent extremism. Alizai, the final commander of Afghan military forces, said he fears that religious fundamentalists stoked Lakanwal’s frustrations and urged him to lash out with violence. \"Lakanwal was not a terrorist in Afghanistan. He was fighting terrorism in Afghanistan. We know how these mosques and these Tablighis can play a role to radicalize anybody.\" CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE.",

            "content": "NEW YORK Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Wednesday predicted that the administration still will be able to implement its tariff agenda regardless of whether it prevails in a pending case before the Supreme Court. Repeating assertions he had made prior to the high court hearing a month ago, Bessent cited several sections of 1962 Trade Act that give the president sweeping powers over import duties. \"We can recreate the exact tariff structure with [sections] 301, with 232, with 122,\" he said during an onstage interview at the New York Times DealBook Summit. Asked by host Andrew Ross Sorkin the founding editor of DealBook and co-host of CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" whether the administration had to implement those measures permanently, Bessent replied, \"permanently.\" Section 122 allows for tariff power up to 150 days, but 301 and 232 are less definitive on time frame. Bessent also cited the International Emergency Economic Powers Act as providing broad tariff authority, though that is the use under scrutiny by the Supreme Court. President Donald Trump has used tariffs as a favorite negotiating tool against U. S. trading partners. The president has slapped duties on a wide range of products and virtually all imports that come into the country, though he has backed off on many of the more aggressive measures. Bessent cited some of the successes the administration has enjoyed thus far, naming China specifically despite ongoing tensions between the two nations. \"Because of the fentanyl tariffs, the Chinese are making the first the step forward that they've made\" on trade, he said. Bessent added that China has made \"a robust effort\" at halting the drug's import into the U. S. He added that he still thinks the U. S. stands a good chance of prevailing in the Supreme Court case. On a separate matter, Bessent dodged a question on Trump's pick for the next Federal Reserve chair and noted the limited power the central bank leader has over interest rates. Recent reports have indicated that National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett is the frontrunner. \"The important thing to remember here is that it's a board and [there are] several other voters from the from the regional banks,\" he said. \"The chair of the Federal Reserve has the ability to move and start the discussion, but at the end of the day . he or she is one vote.\" Bessent told CNBC recently that he thought Trump could make the decision by Christmas, but the president indicated it may not come until the new year.",

            "content": "The founder and “god” of the One Love Family, Satguru Maharaj Ji, has vowed to secure the release of the jailed leader of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra secessionist group, Nnamdi Kanu, who was sentenced to Life Imprisonment. Maharaj Ji disclosed the plan while speaking in an interview granted to his temple’s in-house radio on Wednesday. According to him, the IPOB leader was culpable of the terrorism charges levelled against him, and anyone guilty is liable to a death sentence. Justice James Omotosho sentenced the IPOB leader, Kanu, to life imprisonment after finding him guilty on all seven counts of terrorism charges against him. However, Maharaj Ji, during the interview expressed his willingness to help secure Kanu release but on two strong conditions that “the Biafra radio and sit-at-home order are stopped”. He said, “We are, however, grateful that the matter has been put on hold in the sense that, by the accusations, it is always going to be death, looking at the level of crimes attached to him, with the way and manner the constitution is written. Anybody who is accused of doing such a thing (terrorism) is sentenced to death. It is only out of grace that Kanu was able to escape. “So now it has to be by political settlement before he (Kanu) can be released, and it will be addressed in so many ways. For anyone advocating for his pardon, they have to take positive steps. In other words, they must not do so with empty hands; they should stop the Biafra radio wherever it is. Secondly, the sit-at-home order should be stopped, and the judgment should be accepted while the Igbo elders go behind the scenes to analyse and explain to the President. “Today, the Igbos have been brought to the central realms of politics by Tinubu. And the Northern caliphate is not happy about it. They are not excited about the commission they were given. They should stop the propaganda that the East is about to be Islamised. When those are done, I know how to watch it out, Kanu will come out. I will help facilitate his release.“ The cleric joined the efforts of Abia State governor, Alex Otti, activist Omoyele Sowore, and other South-East leaders to intensify efforts in securing the release of Kanu following his sentence.",

            "content": "My top 10 things to watch Wednesday, Dec. 3 1. Stocks reversed course this morning and were headed for a lower open after a report in The Information said that Microsoft was lowering AI software sales quotas. Elsewhere, ADP data for November showed U. S. companies cut 32, 000 workers versus estimates for a gain of 40, 000. The market believes the Fed will cut interest rates next week. If that happens, it would be the third rate cut this year. 2. CrowdStrike 's beat-and-raise quarter last night was not enough to power shares higher. The stock, off 1% this morning, was still up more than 20% since the previous print back in August. Nothing new here on the stock. It often sells down after earnings and tends to be higher a month later. Business is good at this Club name. 3. Did Amazon Web Services just leapfrog Alphabet 's Google Cloud and Microsoft's Azure with its innovations for business-to-business and the gravitation from on-premise to the cloud? AWS CEO Matt Garman was on \"Mad Money\" last night in a two-parter: . 4. Lloyd Yates, CEO of NiSource was on CNBC early morning, talking about a huge contract the energy company signed with Amazon. Yates said Amazon, as part of the deal, will be paying a fee that will go back to the company's retail customers, resulting in energy cost savings. PG & E said the same. Are the critics of these kinds of deals lying? Kind of. 5. UBS raised its price target on Oklo to $95 from $65, and kept a hold rating on shares. Analysts say Oklo is a winner of the generational build-out of nuclear power. I say good luck. The only small-scale nuclear reactor story that works is Club name GE Vernova 6. Marvell Technology shares surged nearly 10% after the chipmaker posted an extraordinary earnings report last night. Management expects data center revenue to jump 25% during the company's fiscal year 2026. Marvell is the winner in the glass versus copper fight in the data center. The company also announced plans to acquire startup Celestial AI for at least $3. 25 billion, which will be accretive in a short time and is about the great scale-up for racks and how glass will win. 7. Macy's posted a blowout third quarter this morning, which featured its strongest sales growth in over three years. Bloomingdale's had the best performance among all of Macy's brands. Watch \"Macy's Reimagine 125,\" a key part of the company's turnaround strategy that includes renovating 125 locations to drive sales. Macy's CEO Tony Spring is winning right now. Still, the stock tumbled roughly 4% on management's cautious tone around the holiday shopping season. 8. JPMorgan downgraded Wendy's to hold from buy, and cut its price target to $9 from $12. Analysts want a more defined business strategy from management, and argue that the chances of a turnaround for Wendy's U. S. market are very low within the next three years.

            "content": "For Robert Mifflin, it started with sore eyes and a runny nose. Soon, he was experiencing vomiting and nosebleeds. Eventually, after three years, he had developed such severe problems with his breathing that he was unable to work. As head of mortuary services at Oxford University, Mr Mifflin, 57, had spent years being exposed to formaldehyde a cancer-causing chemical which experts have likened to asbestos while carrying out autopsies for the medical school laboratory. Now retired, he is left having to use a walking frame and believes the near-daily exposure to the chemical has “completely wrecked” his life. “We used to be in a motorcycle club. I had to stop that because I couldn’t breathe while riding. It's just ridiculous. We used to do a lot of walking. I can't do that. We take the dog out, but I now have, like, a Zimmer frame with a seat on it, so I can sit down every so often. So, yeah, it's changed a lot. You know, it's difficult.” Mr Mifflin is one of several former NHS and laboratory workers who have spoken to The Independent and Channel 4 News as part of a probe into concerns that staff are being exposed to unacceptably high levels of formaldehyde, which is putting their health at risk. As part of the joint investigation, we have spoken to staff who have been forced to quit their jobs over ill-health after being regularly exposed to levels of formaldehyde deemed unsafe by UK and EU regulators. Experts have warned that regulators and NHS trusts are failing to protect thousands of staff working in labs where formaldehyde will be used every day. However, the issue spans far wider, with the chemical used across multiple industries including by funeral directors and embalmers, vets and university students. Despite the risks, the UK has refused to reduce exposure thresholds to match EU levels in the aftermath of Brexit. Formaldehyde, called formalin in its liquid solution form, can be used to produce resins and adhesives, to preserve cosmetics, and as a disinfectant and fumigant. It can also be used by laboratories to store human tissue samples. The chemical has been classified as cancer-causing in humans by the International Agency for Research on Cancer \"As the legal requirement is already to reduce exposure to the lowest reasonably practicable level, there would be no health risk benefit to be gained by lowering the current workplace exposure limit. \"We are aware of the research concerning formaldehyde exposure in NHS pathology departments and have met with the researchers to discuss their findings.”.",

            "content": "Florida health officials are investigating an outbreak of Legionnaires' disease after at least 14 confirmed cases were linked back to a central Florida gym, according to reports. The Florida Health Department confirmed the outbreak, without specifying which gym was involved, according to an email obtained by WFTV 9. While health officials have not named the gym, WFTV 9 reported a week earlier that some members of a Crunch Fitness in Ocoee, a city just west of Orlando, had Legionnaire’s disease. At least one woman who went to the gym has been hospitalized and diagnosed with Legionnaires’ disease, ClickOrlando reported, citing Legionnaires Lawyers, a law firm that says the outbreak could have had as many as 28 potential exposures. Legionnaires’ disease is a severe form of pneumonia that can sometimes be deadly, though oftentimes it is mild. It is caused by Legionella bacteria, which can be found in water systems and air conditioning systems. The disease is not transmitted person-to-person, but can be through water particles, according to the Orange County Health Department. “I just think that people should know. People are coming here to work out to be safe, to be healthy, not to walk into a situation to get sick,” gym member Carla Jones told ClickOrlando. Jones said she inquired about the outbreak and was pointed to an information board posted in the facility. “I guess they got a board of information,” she said. “I said OK, but why would we read about it? But why would that not be something you tell people when they walk in?” Crunch said it was working with the Health Department during their investigation and has closed off parts of the gym to test the water of its pool and spa systems. The Crunch Fitness facility had previously been an LA Fitness, where health officials investigated three Legionnaires’ cases in 2017, according to the reports. Crunch said it spent over $5 million renovating the facility, including the HVAC and aquatic systems, before opening in 2024. The health department declined to comment on ongoing investigations. Meanwhile, the gym remains open for members to visit. Jones told ClickOrlando she decided not to work out after speaking with facility staff. “We need to be safe in that environment,” she said. The Independent has contact Crunch Fitness for comment.",

            "content": "Mary Cutter was crushed when she lost her only child, 24-year-old son Christian, to a sudden death in 2012. But she is comforted in knowing that Christian’s heart still beats 13 years later in the chest of a now 25-year-old Ohioan whose life was saved when Cutter donated her son's organs. The change has made the crucial, life-continuing medicines unaffordable. Herres, from Dayton, said receiving Christian’s heart when she was just 11 was the “ultimate gift” and even sent his mom a teddy bear stocked with a recording of it beating in her chest. Now, Cutter is joining Herres’ fight to ensure her son’s gift keeps on giving. “I'll do whatever I can to keep hers and my son's heart going,” Cutter told The Independent in an emotional joint interview with Herres. It was the first time they’d heard one another’s voices. Even though they have never met in person, the 65-year-old mom from Cincinnati offered to step in and cover the cost of the medication. “My son donated all his organs to help people and [Herres] has a chance to live a good life,” Cutter said. “And for the insurance companies to do something like that you know, it's heart-wrenching.” In the years since Christian’s death, Cutter, has also lost her husband and brother. “I'm the only one left,” she said. “But you know, Payton's there with Christian.” Christian was Cutter’s only child. She described him as a funny, smart, “amazing kid.” He was with the Reserve Officers' Training Corps at the University of Cincinnati for a couple of years before his life was tragically cut short. He died unexpectedly on March 17, 2012. In Cutter’s darkest days at the hospital, after learning that Christian was not going to make it, she made the difficult decision to donate his organs. “If you know your child's gonna die, if somebody else has a child, and Christian could help them live .,” she said, trailing off into tears. “I thought if somebody else didn't have to lose their child, it was something that I could do. I was willing to do it.” At the same time, Herres was in urgent need of a new heart doctors didn’t think she would make it to her 12th birthday due to a rare congenital heart disease, Ebstein’s anomaly. The condition affects the tricuspid valve on the right side of the heart and causes blood to leak backward into the right atrium upper right chamber of the heart, leading to heart failure. Herres received Christian’s heart the day after he died. Cutter said if anything happened to her son’s heart, “it would be like living the whole thing over again.” Since the surgery at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital 13 years ago, Herres has been on a combination of medications to ensure her body doesn’t reject that heart. Some of them made her incredibly unwell and it took years to find a combination that worked. But this year, Herres who earns $35,000 a year doing payroll at a faith-based non-profit had to fight the health insurance company she’s been with all her life, Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield, when they stopped covering one of the life-saving meds. In February, the insurer, which is paid for by her employer, wrote to inform Herres that the drug everolimus was “no longer medically necessary,” according to paperwork previously seen by The Independent. Herres’ doctors prescribed the drug everolimus because it prevents the body from rejecting an organ transplant. It also helps protect against coronary artery disease, a major risk after transplant operations. Everolimus, when taken with the immunosuppressant cyclosporine, had been working well for Herres since 2013. The drug is currently only approved by the Food and Drug Administration for liver and kidney transplant recipients, something Herres is campaigning to change through a petition. More research is needed before everolimus can be approved for heart transplant patients, but studies have shown it reduces rejection risk, protected the kidneys and slowed the progression of cardiac allograft vasculopathy a form of coronary artery disease unique to heart transplant patients. “Heart transplant patients deserve the same level of access and protection afforded to other organ recipients,” Herres said, adding that her petition calls for the FDA and the drug manufacturer, Novartis, to review the evidence. Still, after creating some noise around her situation, in mid-September, Anthem contacted Herres’ doctors and informed them that the medication had been approved. But there was a catch her copay more than doubled to $350 for a 30-day supply, or $1,000 for a 90-day supply. Before the hike, Herres, supported by her parents, would pay around $180 for a 90-day supply. The new copay is simply unaffordable for her. An Anthem spokesperon said that there was a cheaper alternative if Herres used their mail-order service in a statement to The Independent. “Purchasing the medication through our mail-order service allows her to obtain a 90-day supply at the same cost as a 30-day supply at a retail pharmacy,” the spokesperson said. “This mail-order option, which she used last year, results in lower out-of-pocket costs.” But Herres said that she had not received a clear explanation from Anthem of the pricing they mentioned in their statement and she can’t risk delays to her medication that might occur with a mail-order service, which potentially can leave gaps between when a supply runs out and is received for resupply through the mail. And many insurers now allow those 90-day maintenance supplies, at the discounted price, to be filled through local chain pharmacies like CVS and Walgreens. “Nothing they’ve shared has solved the fact that my out-of-pocket cost went up so much that I had to look outside of my insurance to afford the medication,” Herres said. “It hasn’t protected me from huge cost increases, and it isn’t a simple or fully safe solution for a life-sustaining transplant drug.” Herres told Cutter about her ordeal on the phone call. The mom repeated her generous offer to cover the medication costs, and further yet, pick them up and deliver them to Herres herself. “When I saw she wanted to pay, it just broke me,” said Herres. “It was one of the most beautiful and most wrong things I've ever experienced.” “It's beautiful because it showed how deeply she loves me and still loves her son through me. But at the same time, it's wrong because she's already given the ultimate gift,” she added. At the moment, the most affordable way Herres can secure her medication is by bypassing her insurance completely and using GoodRx coupons, which bring the cost down to $234. 86 out of pocket for a 90 day supply but it’s far from reliable. “The scary part is that these coupons aren’t guaranteed. They can change [the price] or disappear at any time,” said Herres. “If that happens, I could never afford those prices, and that terrifies me.” Herres said she can’t take Cutter up on the kind gesture to pay for her medication, nor can she ever repay her for giving her a “second chance at life.” But to say thank you, Herres bought the mom a blue teddy bear, sprinkled with stars, which plays the sound of Christian’s heartbeat when its right paw is squeezed. “I let everybody listen to Christian's heart, and it brings tears to our eyes every time,” said Cutter. “It's beautiful. It was a very special gift.” During their first phone call together, Herres repeatedly thanked Cutter for saving her life. “I'm forever grateful for Christian and Mary,” said Herres. “They've done a lot for me, and it just breaks my heart that they have to see me go through this.” “You don't need to thank me,” Cutter replied. “I'm thankful that Christian's heart is beating in your chest.”.",

            "content": "PHOENIX An arrest has been made in this week’s deadly shooting in a Tempe Marketplace parking lot, authorities announced Wednesday. Fernando Gallegos, 20, is accused of killing 19-year-old Dominic Baysinger after they’d arranged a meeting to complete an online transaction, according to the Tempe Police Department. Gallegos was booked into jail on Tuesday on one count each of first-degree murder, conspiracy and armed robbery with a deadly weapon. His bond was set at $1. 2 million. No details about how Gallegos was identified as the suspect were immediately available. What did authorities say about deadly Tempe Marketplace shooting? Baysinger was killed around 11 a. m. Monday in a parking lot outside Road Runner Sports in Tempe Marketplace. He’d gone to the large outdoor mall near McClintock Drive and Rio Salado Parkway with his girlfriend after arranging a transaction online, police said. The suspect fled the scene after the shooting. When officers arrived, they found Baysinger with critical injuries. He was pronounced dead at the scene. It was Monday’s second deadly shooting in Tempe. Earlier, a man allegedly killed his wife and her coworker at the Little Caesars near Rural and Guadalupe roads. Benjaman Visser Jr., 27, was arrested on two counts of first-degree murder in that case.",

The customisable dolls were reportedly being sold on major online shopping sites and social media platforms. Chinese state-owned news outlet The Paper said that local officials were attaching \"great importance\" to the issue. Last month, online retailer Shein which started in China but is now headquartered in Singapore banned the sale of all sex dolls globally after a public outcry over it selling dolls with a childlike appearance. The company said at the time it had \"strengthened its keyword blacklist to further prevent attempted circumvention of product listing restrictions by sellers\". Other e-commerce sites have also faced criticism over the sale of sex dolls which have childlike features. AliExpress has been investigated by French authorities over the issue. Reuters reported in November that the China-based company had banned a seller which sold sex dolls, after it \"repeatedly denied ever selling sex toys on any platform\", AliExpress said. Sweden has also vowed to take action against online retailers selling these types of dolls. \"I now start from the principle that electronic commerce companies assume their responsibilities and do everything possible to end the marketing of sexual dolls that resemble children,\" Social Services Minister Camilla Waltersson Gronvall told AFP. \"If we see that this evolution does not happen, or is not enough, the government will not hesitate to legislate different means.\".",

            "content": "The Department for Work and Pension’s (DWP) ‘bank spying bill’ has come into force and gives government agents new powers to tackle benefits fraud. The Public Authorities (Fraud, Error and Debt) Bill gives DWP agents new powers to request information from benefit claimants’ bank accounts, and to directly recover funds in certain circumstances. The key power that will enable to DWP to request banks to share financial information with its agents is called the Eligibility Verification Measure. It means that when a new Eligibility Verification Notice is sent to a bank or financial institution, it must comply with the request. The information the institution can be asked to share includes information about the account holder, including their name and date of birth. Agents can also ask for the bank account’s sort code and account number, as well as details about how the account meets eligibility. Transaction information should not be shared by banks, the DWP says. Banks and other financial institutions can be issued penalty notices for not-complying with these requests. Ministers say the government is introducing these powers to be able to determine if an individual is eligible for a benefit they are claiming or have applied for based on their financial position. For example, holding over £16, 000 in savings generally will render someone ineligible for Universal Credit, except in certain limited circumstances. The measures are understood to have a planned implementation period of 12 months using ‘phased approach’ and working with a smaller number of banks initially. The DWP will also gain controversial new powers to directly deduct money from an individual’s earnings or bank accounts using a ‘Direct Deduction Order’. Baroness Maeve Sherlock, a minster of state for the DWP, said earlier this year that the department estimates it will make between 5, 000 and 20, 000 Direct Deduction Orders every year. The new powers have been introduced as part of a raft of measures Labour say will form the “biggest fraud crackdown in a generation.” The government adds that, combined, the plans will save £1. 5 billion by 2029/30. But campaigners have criticised the new powers as “intrusive,” with civil liberties watchdog Big Brother Watch previously warning that it “threatens to usher in an unprecedented system of mass financial surveillance.” Minister for transformation Andrew Western MP said: “It is right that as fraud against the public sector evolves, the government has a robust and resolute response. “The powers granted through the Bill will allow us to better identify, prevent and deter fraud and error, and enable the better recovery of debt owed to the taxpayer.",

            "content": "The man arrested for allegedly attacking a 20-year-old New York University (NYU) student near the college’s Manhattan campus had 16 prior arrests, according to police. James Rizzo, 45, was busted by the New York City Police Department (NYPD) and charged with persistent sexual abuse, forcible touching and assault in relation to the incident. Rizzo allegedly approached the student from behind at around 9: 20 a. m. Monday, slapped her head and buttocks, pulled her hair and ran off, police said. RETIRED OFFICER SAYS US 'A DIFFERENT COUNTRY' FROM 5 YEARS AGO AFTER SPREE OF VIOLENT ATTACKS ON WOMEN He was perp-walked out of a Manhattan police precinct on Tuesday night, dressed in a black hoodie and gray sweatpants. He did not say anything to quizzing reporters as he was escorted into a police car. The New York Post reported Rizzo’s 16 prior arrests include sexual abuse, forcible touching, repeated assaults on women, burglary and a 1997 murder arrest. New York state prison records show Rizzo has no murder conviction on his record. Rizzo previously served a two-year state sentence for persistent sexual abuse before being released on parole in September, the records show. He was still on active parole on Monday. WATCH: NYU student allegedly assaulted on way to class, video shows The victim, identified on social media as NYU student Amelia Lewis, posted video and surveillance footage of the attack on X and TikTok, saying a man had assaulted her on the street without warning. \"When I turned around, I saw this old, White guy, and, like right when I turned around, he like grabbed my f hair like this and like yanked me and threw me to the ground,\" Lewis said. NYC DEMOCRAT DEMANDS FIRINGS AFTER VIOLENT CRIMINAL IS RELEASED EARLY, THEN ARRESTED IN TRIPLE SLASHING A group of girls is then seen in the footage helping her up after she was knocked to the ground. Lewis said the surveillance video was obtained by a friend of hers from a nearby liquor store. She described the assailant as a tall man with long brown hair and a long brown beard, wearing gray sweatpants, a black puffer jacket and a blue towel around his neck. WATCH: NYU student recounts shocking street attack The college student said she sent the video to NYU security, who forwarded the footage to police. \"The University is pleased that a suspect has been apprehended in the attack on one of its students that took place Monday morning on a Broadway sidewalk. We take this incident very seriously,\" said NYU spokesperson John Beckman. \"We are continuing to offer support to the student, and our Campus Safety Department assisted the victim and worked with the police investigating the incident. I just really want to emphasize how not OK this is. I am a student at NYU. I should not be scared to be walking the street to go to my 9: 30 a. m. class. These people are disgusting, and they should not be able to be walking around the street freely targeting girls and doing this. Cause I heard that this guy did this a month ago,\" Lewis said in the video. \"I'm honestly still in shock, but I'm more enraged that things like this are able to happen in this city, and we really need to do something about it because this is unacceptable,\" she continued.

            "content": "It is a hit rate that trumps any opposing argument. Ten times the world's best teams have assembled for a World Cup final, and nine times the William Webb Ellis trophy has headed off in southern hemisphere hands. New Zealand in 1987, 2011 and 2015. Australia in 1991 and 1999. South Africa in 1995, 2007, 2019 and 2023. The Tri-Nations triopoly has been broken only once 2003, Jonny Wilkinson's glorious dropper and all that. England's triumph came at Sydney's Stadium Australia, the venue that will host the 2027 final. And, as the balls were plucked from pots and placed into pools in Wednesday's draw, the possibility of the northern hemisphere adding to that paltry total seemed to rise. England and Ireland, ranked third and fourth in the world behind South Africa and New Zealand, were placed in pools F and D respectively. Should all four teams live up to their seedings and progress as pool winners, England and Ireland would be on the opposite side of the draw from the two southern hemisphere superpowers and unable to meet them until the final. England and Ireland would also be kept apart from each other until the semis, while the Springboks and All Blacks would be on a quarter-final collision course, ensuring one would fall before the last four. Should France advance as pool winners and it is difficult to see Japan, USA or Samoa preventing them Fabien Galthie's side would be primed to try and pick off whoever emerges from that titanic encounter. Scotland, who have gone out in the pool stages in three of the past four tournaments, could hijack France's route into the latter stages. Gregor Townsend's side have won only one of their past 16 meetings with Ireland, including coming off on the wrong end of a Pool B meeting at France 2023. If that trend continues in Pool D but Scotland see off Uruguay and Portugal, they would most likely meet France against whom their record is much better in the last 16. The current rankings predict that a quarter-final against Fiji would follow. Even Wales, mired in dire form and structural upheaval behind the scenes, have reason to be cheerful. Tonga and Zimbabwe are far more friendly Pool F opposition than a worst-case scenario of Georgia, winners at Principality Stadium in 2022 and itching to make a point over a potential place in the Six Nations, and Samoa, who inflicted famous World Cup defeats on Wales in 1991 and 1999. A runner-up spot in Pool F will earn a last-16 tie against the team that finish second among Argentina, Fiji, Spain and Canada in Pool C. Now, for the caveats. At the moment, at a point in the World Cup cycle when they are normally building, South Africa are without equal. However you split the 24 teams, they would be favourites and deservedly so.",

            "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) The Trump administration is pausing all immigration applications such as requests for green cards for people from 19 countries banned from travel earlier this year, as part of sweeping immigration changes in the wake of the shooting of two National Guard troops. The changes were outlined in a policy memo posted Tuesday on the website of U. S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, the agency tasked with processing and approving all requests for immigration benefits. The pause puts on hold a wide range of immigration-related decisions such as green card applications or naturalizations for immigrants from those 19 countries that the Trump administration has described as high-risk. It’s up to the agency’s director, Joseph Edlow, on when to lift the pause, the memo said. The administration in June banned travel to the U. S. by citizens of 12 countries and restricted access for those from seven others, citing national security concerns. The ban applied to citizens of Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, the Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen while the restricted access applied to people from Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela. At the time, no action was taken against immigrants from those countries who were already in the U. S. before the travel ban went into effect. But now the news from USCIS means those people already in the U. S. regardless of when they arrived will come under extra scrutiny. The agency said it would conduct a comprehensive review of all “approved benefit requests” for immigrants who entered the country during the Biden administration. The agency cited the shooting of two National Guard troops by a suspect who is an Afghan national as a reason for the pause and heightened scrutiny for people from those countries. One National Guard soldier was killed and another wounded in the Thanksgiving week shooting near the White House. “In light of identified concerns and the threat to the American people, USCIS has determined that a comprehensive re-review, potential interview, and re-interview of all aliens from high-risk countries of concern who entered the United States on or after January 20, 2021 is necessary,” the agency said. The agency said in the Tuesday memo that within 90 days it would create a prioritized list of immigrants for review and if necessary, referral to immigration enforcement or other law enforcement agencies. Since the shooting, the administration has announced a flurry of decisions it was taking to scrutinize immigrants already in the country and those seeking to come to the U. S. Last week, the director of USCIS said in a social media post that his agency would be reexamining green card applications for people from countries “of concern.” But the policy directive Tuesday goes further and lays out in more detail the scope of who will be affected. USCIS also said last week that it was pausing all asylum decisions, and the State Department said it was halting visas for Afghans who assisted the U. S. war effort. Days before the shooting, USCIS said in a separate memo that the administration would review the cases of all refugees who entered the U. S. during the Biden administration. Critics have said that the Trump administration’s actions have amounted to collective punishment for immigrants. Copyright.",

            "content": "India has revoked an order to smartphone manufacturers to install a government-owned cybersecurity application on all new mobile devices following massive backlash amid digital rights concerns. According to an official notification issued by the Department of Telecommunications on November 28, all leading smartphone makers, including Apple and Samsung, were given 90 days to add the government’s Sanchar Saathi application to all newly manufactured devices. Recommended Stories list of 3 items list 1 of 3How Israeli spy veterans are shaping US Big Tech list 2 of 3Microsoft cuts Israeli military’s access to some cloud, AI products list 3 of 3South Korea police seek warrants for 58 repatriated scam centre suspects end of list The government, led by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), said the order was part of a move to tackle fraud and misuse of mobile phones. The order faced pushback, however, both from tech companies and digital privacy advocates. Prior to its withdrawal, Apple, based in the United States, reportedly said it would not comply with the order due to a host of privacy- and security-related issues. Here is what we know. What did the order say? Under the directive issued by India’s Department of Telecommunications, manufacturers were told to ensure that Sanchar Saathi was “pre-installed on all mobile handsets manufactured or imported for use in India” within 90 days. The app, manufacturers were told, was to be “readily visible and accessible to the end users at the time of first use or device setup” and its features “not disabled or restricted”. For devices already in supply, manufacturers and importers were told to “make an endeavour to push the App through software updates”, the order stated. The directive also required companies to submit compliance reports to the telecom ministry within 120 days. According to a survey conducted by the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI) in May, more than 85 percent of households in India own smartphones. Why did the Indian government order this? Justifying the order, the government said the country’s Telecom Cyber Security Rules empower it to set up mechanisms “necessary to identify and report acts that may endanger telecom cyber security”, and that Sanchar Saathi will enable “stakeholders to report International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) related suspicious misuse and also to verify authenticity of IMEIs used in mobile devices”. The IMEI is a unique 15-digit number that is used to identify a specific mobile device. How did smartphone manufacturers respond? An industry source familiar with Apple’s concern regarding the app told Reuters that the tech giant would explain to the Indian government that it does not follow any such mandates anywhere in the world. Another industry insider told Reuters that South Korean-based tech company Samsung was reviewing the order, but had not given any details about how it planned to pursue the matter. What were the criticisms of the order? The Internet Freedom Foundation (IFF) of India called it a “deeply worrying expansion of executive control over personal digital devices”. “The stated objective of curbing IMEI fraud and improving telecom security is, on its face, a legitimate state aim. But the means chosen are disproportionate, legally fragile, and structurally hostile to user privacy and autonomy,” it said in a statement. Congress leader and Lok Sabha member Priyanka Gandhi called Sanchar Saathi a “snooping” app and “ridiculous”. The Delhi-based Software Freedom Law Centre told Al Jazeera the directive was another example of attempts “to take away user autonomy, make a mockery of consent and have 24 hours State in My Home measure”. “This is the start of a slippery slope of function creep. Such deep integration of state software on private devices ensures an expansion of surveillance capacities without fresh public debate each time new changes are made,” it said. “Government has no business being in our devices that are more intimate to us than our loved ones.” A similar controversy arose in 2020, when the Indian government required all public and private sector employees to use its COVID-19 contact tracing app, Aarogya Setu, which critics described as a “privacy minefield”. When did India revoke the order? Early on Wednesday, the government said it would be willing to amend the order “based on the feedback we receive”. Hours later, the order was revoked. “Government has decided not to make the pre-installation mandatory for mobile manufacturers,” India’s Communications Ministry said in a press statement. “The app is secure and purely meant to help citizens from bad actors in the cyber world,” it added. The IFF said that while this was a “welcome development”, it was still awaiting the full legal order accompanying the revocation. Are other countries making similar orders? Earlier this year, Russia launched Max, an app aimed at curbing the use of stolen phones in fraud schemes while also broadening access to state-backed digital services. Russian authorities claim Max is more secure than apps provided by foreign competitors. Developed by the state-controlled tech firm VK, Max is integrated with government platforms and has been mandatory on all new mobile phones and tablets sold since September 1. Moscow said the move would ensure a “safer” digital ecosystem. However, critics argue the app is likely to be used for surveillance purposes, an allegation Moscow has rejected. In August, Russia announced restrictions on voice calls on the WhatsApp and Telegram messaging apps, saying they had become the main voice services used to “involve Russian citizens in sabotage and terrorist activities”. It alleged that requests to take countermeasures had been “ignored” by the owners of the social media apps.",

            "content": "KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia -- Malaysia's transport ministry said Wednesday that a private firm will resume a deep-sea hunt for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 later this month, renewing hopes of finally locating the jet that vanished without a trace more than a decade ago. The search will be carried out by Texas-based marine robotics firm Ocean Infinity, which signed a new \"no-find, no-fee\" contract with Malaysia's government in March. Ocean Infinity made its first seabed search operation for the plane in 2018 under a similar deal and found nothing. The firm restarted the seabed search operation at a new 15, 000-square-kilometer (5, 800-square-mile) site in the Indian Ocean after Malaysia's government gave it the greenlight, but the search was halted in April due to bad weather. Ocean Infinity will be paid $70 million only if wreckage is discovered. It is unclear if the company has new evidence of the plane's location. Ocean Infinity CEO Oliver Punkett reportedly said last year that the company had improved its technology since 2018. He has said the firm is working with many experts to analyze data and had narrowed the search area to the most likely site. The Boeing 777 plane disappeared from radar shortly after taking off on March 8, 2014, carrying 239 people, mostly Chinese nationals, on a flight from Malaysia's capital, Kuala Lumpur, to Beijing. Satellite data showed the plane turned from its flight path and headed south to the far-southern Indian Ocean, where it is believed to have crashed. An expensive multinational search failed to turn up any clues to its location, although debris washed ashore on the east African coast and Indian Ocean islands. Malaysia's transport ministry said in a brief statement Wednesday that Ocean Infinity will search intermittently from Dec. 30 for a total of 55 days, in targeted areas believed to have the highest likelihood of finding the missing aircraft. \"The latest development underscores the government of Malaysia's commitment in providing closure to the families affected by this tragedy,\" it said. In Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said, \"We . appreciate the efforts made by the Malaysian side.\".",

            "content": "A nursery worker who filmed himself sexually abusing four children has pleaded guilty to 26 offences, in what has been described as “one of the most significant and disturbing child protection cases in recent history”. Vincent Chan, 45, a British national of Chinese heritage, abused children as young as three years old while they napped, as well as took sickening images of them in distress while using a work iPad. Chan was first arrested in June 2024, after a member of nursery staff reported that he had callously filmed a child falling asleep in their food and set it to music, before showing the clip to a colleague. He was initially held on suspicion of neglect and released on bail, losing his job at the nursery, which has since closed. Following his arrest, officers seized 25 digital devices from his home and three from the nursery and discovered a cache of “deeply disturbing” material. Over the course of their “highly complex” investigation, the police seized a total 69 devices from his property, including hard drives and laptops, to uncover the extent of his offending. He is known to have abused at least four little girls while working in the West Hampstead nursery between 2017 and 2024. Chan pleaded guilty to 26 offences relating to sexual assault offences against children and the taking and making of indecent images of children. The offences include five counts of sexual assault of a child by penetration, four counts of sexual assault of a child by touching, 11 counts of taking indecent photographs or pseudo-photographs of a child, and six counts of making indecent photographs or pseudo-photographs of a child. To date, police have seized 51 devices from Chan and 18 that he used at the nursery, a since-closed branch of Bright Horizons in West Hampstead, north-west London. The families of the victims have been contacted directly and are receiving specialist support, while the NSPCC is running a helpline for all 700 families of children who attended the nursery during the time Chan worked there between 2017 and 2024. Through the lawyers Leigh Day, the families said: \"As parents we are still trying to process the sickening discovery that our children were subjected to despicable abuse by Vincent Chan at the nursery. “In admitting the charges, we are spared the prospect of hearing Vincent Chan's crimes at the nursery described in graphic detail in a trial. We trust the judge to pass the strongest sentence to fit the crimes Vincent Chan has committed against young children, innocent victims who could not fight back. “We would like to thank the Metropolitan Police Service for their assistance and support so far, but appreciate that their investigations in this case are not yet complete.” Detective Superintendent Lewis Basford, who led the Met’s investigation, said: “Child sexual abuse is one of the most horrific crimes imaginable, and Chan’s offending spanned years, revealing a calculated and predatory pattern of abuse. He infiltrated environments that should have been safe havens for children, exploiting the trust of families and the wider community to conceal his actions and prey on the most vulnerable. “Our investigation remains ongoing, and we are continuing to review digital devices and assess Chan’s conduct across all relevant settings. We recognise the member of staff who raised their concerns, as without that first report of child cruelty Chan’s abuse could have continued unchecked, putting countless more children at risk. “These appalling offences have caused deep shock and distress. We thank the community for its continued cooperation and reaffirm our commitment to supporting victims and their families. If you have any concerns, please contact the dedicated NSPCC helpline on 0808 800 5000 for specialist support. We are working closely with the NSPCC to ensure every family affected receives the help they need.”.",

            "content": "Israel says it will open Gaza's main gateway in the next few days, allowing thousands of Palestinians who are in need of medical care to leave the war-ravaged enclave through Egypt. COGAT, the Israeli military arm that oversees humanitarian matters, said the opening of the Rafah crossing will be coordinated with Egypt, under the supervision of the European Union mission, similar to a mechanism employed during a previous Gaza ceasefire agreed in January 2025. Under U. S. President Donald Trump's 20-point plan that has largely halted the two-year war between Israel and Hamas militants, the crossing was to open in both directions. Before the war, the Rafah crossing was the only direct exit point for most Palestinians in Gaza to reach the outside world and was a key entry point for aid into the territory. It has been mostly closed throughout the conflict. At least 16, 500 patients in Gaza are in need of medical care outside of the enclave, according to the United Nations. Some Gazans managed to leave for medical treatment abroad through Israel. \"We have been waiting for the Rafah opening for months,\" said Gaza businessman Tamer al-Burai, who needs treatment abroad for a respiratory condition. \"At last, I and thousands of other patients may have a chance to receive proper treatment,\" Burai said. Israel has kept Rafah shut in both directions since the ceasefire came into effect in October, saying that Hamas must abide by the agreement to return all hostages still in Gaza, living and deceased. Hamas has returned all 20 living hostages in exchange for around 2, 000 Palestinian detainees and convicted prisoners, but two more deceased captives an Israeli police officer and a Thai agricultural worker are still in Gaza. Islamic Jihad, a Palestinian militant group allied with Hamas which had also held some of the hostages taken in the October 7, 2023, attack on Israel that triggered the war, said on Wednesday that it was searching together with the Red Cross for the body of one of the remaining deceased captives. The Islamic Jihad announcement came a day after Hamas handed over remains it said were of one of the two deceased hostages, but which were found not to belong to either of them following forensic tests in Israel. Handing over all the hostages was a central tenet of the first phase of the ceasefire. Major obstacles lie ahead of the next phase, including the question of Hamas disarming, Israel's withdrawal from Gaza, governance of the enclave and international security arrangements.",

            "content": "Rome’s public transport operator, Atac, has committed to refunding passengers for substandard service. The announcement from Italy’s competition authority on Wednesday brings an end to its investigation into the publicly run body. The regulator launched its probe in February, scrutinising Atac for “possible unfair commercial practices” over alleged failures to meet quality standards between 2021 and 2023. Specific issues highlighted included a lack of punctuality, malfunctioning escalators and lifts, and insufficient security personnel at metro stations. The investigation has now concluded after Atac pledged to allocate more than €3 million (£2. 6 million) for refunds to annual ticket holders. However, they will receive just a small fraction of what they paid. Annual ticket holders for 2024 will receive €5 each, and an extra €5 will be given to holders of annual travel passes in any year between 2021 and 2023, it said. The annual passes cost €250, excluding concessions. Atac will also introduce a new mobile app offering partial refunds to users in the event of delays of more than 15 minutes in regular bus, tram or metro services. Public transport in Rome is notoriously inefficient, but Atac told the regulator that it had improved thanks to EU post-Covid funds and government funding to prepare for this year's Catholic Holy Year. The special event, typically held every 25 years, is is expected to draw up to 32 million tourists to the city over the course of 2025. Atac, which is owned by Rome's municipality, said it was “undergoing a major renovation of its assets and procedures, which has led to visible improvements throughout its operations”. As part of its commitments, Atac also pledged to hire more staff at metro stations and train existing personnel, with an annual investment of €2. 6 million, the authority said. Atac had no comment on the regulator's announcements.",

            "content": "A nursery worker has admitted sexually abusing young children in his care in north London. Vincent Chan, 45, appeared at Wood Green Crown Court where he pleaded guilty to 26 charges including sexual assault by penetration, sexual assault by touching and making indecent images depicting the most severe category of child sex abuse. The investigation into Chan followed a tip-off from a whistleblower and became one of the most \"harrowing and complex\" cases undertaken by the Metropolitan Police, the force said. Chan, of Stanhope Avenue in Finchley, will be sentenced on 23 January. Det Supt Lewis Basford, who led the Met Police's investigation, said the offences had caused \"deep shock and distress\". The force said it was one of the most complex and disturbing cases that officers had investigated. Chan started work at the nursery in 2017 and took on a number of roles including art specialist, room leader and nursery nurse. He was entrusted with the care of children aged between two and four. He first came to attention for filming the children in his care and overlaying the video with audio, according to the Met. You can also follow @BBCBreaking on X to get the latest alerts.",

            "content": "A new nasal spray vaccine for whooping cough could be pivotal in halting the spread of the highly contagious and often deadly disease, scientists have announced. England has seen a significant surge, with around 15, 000 cases reported in 2024 a sharp rise from 856 last year. Despite existing NHS vaccines for babies, children, and pregnant women, a government-funded trial showed the BPZE1 nasal spray prevents whooping cough bacteria from colonising the nose and throat, vital for stopping spread. It also triggered strong immune responses in both nasal passages and blood, suggesting long-lasting protection. Current vaccines do not provide lifelong protection and do not stop people from carrying the bacteria or spreading it. The trial is backed by the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR), which is funded by the Department of Health and Social Care. Public health minister Ashley Dalton said the trial marks a “major breakthrough in our fight against whooping cough”. “Unlike the existing vaccine for pregnant women, which protects babies in the womb and prevents nine out of 10 infant deaths, this new nasal spray vaccine works in a completely different way by stopping the bacteria from living in the nose and throat. “That means it could cut transmission and offer longer-lasting protection for everyone, not just newborns. “It’s a powerful showcase of the UK’s world-class research sector, driving innovation to protect future generations.” Professor Robert Read, who led the study at the NIHR Southampton Biomedical Research Centre, said the vaccine “could represent a big step forward in stopping the spread of the disease”. The Champion-1 study for the vaccine, developed by ILiAD Biotechnologies, included 53 adults and was published in The Lancet Microbe journal. If the findings are confirmed in further trials and the new vaccine is approved, it could be given to adults or children. The first signs of whooping cough are similar to a cold, but it develops into coughing bouts that can include a “whoop” sound. The cough can last several weeks or months and parents are urged to seek an urgent appointment if their baby is under six months and has symptoms of whooping cough. The whooping cough vaccine is routinely given as part of the 6-in-1 vaccine for young babies, while a pre-school booster is also given at age three. Pregnant women can have the vaccine when they are around 20 weeks pregnant.",

Natasha Osawaru Idibia, a lawmaker from Edo State. In a viral video trending on social media, he expressed deep concern over how far things have escalated, warning that the situation has become dangerous. According to him, fans are already pushing narratives that could put Natasha at risk. He said he is perfectly fine and urged everyone to “calm down” and “cease fire,” noting that while every family has issues, the public perception of his marriage is getting out of control. 2Face explained that he didn’t make any alarming posts, and pleaded repeatedly for people to stop spreading chaos. He ended with a strong appeal to friends, fans and family: stop the rumours, stop the panic. He said, “This issue is getting out of hand, and you people are putting Natasha at risk. I’m perfectly okay. Someone else posted that on my IG; I’m not the one who posted it. Families do have issues, but we will definitely resolve everything.” TVC previously reported that 2face spoke publicly for the first time since the alleged marital controversy surrounding him and his wife, Natasha Osawaru. In a short cryptic message shared on his official Instagram Story on Wednesday, the singer wrote, “Help me.” His post comes hours after his brother, Hyacinth Idibia, raised concern in an Instagram post in which he related his message to an old musical line from one of 2face’s songs.",

            "content": "The European Union's former foreign policy chief faces corruption accusations alongside two other people arrested this week as part of a fraud investigation, the European Public Prosecutor’s Office said on Wednesday. Authorities in Belgium made the arrests on Tuesday after raiding the offices of the EU diplomatic service in Brussels, and a college in Bruges. Federica Mogherini led the EU foreign service from 2014 to 2019 and now serves as the rector of the College of Europe. The EPPO said in a statement that Mogherini and a senior staff member of the College of Europe were detained at its request, as well as a senior official from the European Commission. “After being questioned by the Belgian Federal Judicial Police, the three individuals were formally notified of the accusations against them,” the EPPO said. “The accusations concern procurement fraud and corruption, conflict of interest and violation of professional secrecy. They were released, as they are not considered a flight risk.” Police searched the properties of suspects, several buildings of the College of Europe, and at the headquarters of the European External Action Service that sits at the center of the 27-nation bloc’s institutions in Brussels, the EPPO said. The EPPO, an independent public organization of the EU, said it had “strong suspicions” of fraud in awarding a tender for running a 2021 to 2022 training program at the EU Diplomatic Academy for junior diplomats. Former Vice-President of the European Commission Josep Borrell ran the EEAS.",

            "content": "Terence Crawford has been stripped of his WBC super middleweight title by the governing body. The American defeated Canelo Alvarez in September to become undisputed champion, winning the WBC belt alongside the WBA, IBF and WBO titles. But after failing to pay sanctioning fees for his last two bouts WBC president Mauricio Sulaiman has stripped him of the WBC belt. Speaking at the body’s annual convention in Bangkok, Thailand, Sulaiman said Crawford had failed to pay $300,000 for his fight with Canelo, having already failed to pay after beating Israil Madrimov at super welterweight last August. “The WBC put champion Crawford on notice of his failure to comply with express mandates of the WBC rules and regulations,” Sulaiman explained, referring specifically to the non-payment of fees. “The WBC sent multiple communications to champion Crawford, his manager, and his legal counsel. Very unfortunately, the WBC did not even receive an acknowledgement of receipt, nor any response to any of those communications. “The WBC had no choice but to act, considering champion Crawford had received ample notification and multiple opportunities to address and resolve the situation.” Sulaiman described his behaviour as “a slap in the face”. Crawford, who defeated Alvarez by unanimous decision, lasted just 81 days as undisputed champion. With the championship now vacant, the WBC has ordered interim champion Christian Mbilli to face the No 2 contender, British fighter Hamzah Sheeraz, for the super middleweight title. The winner will face Lester Martinez, who held Mbilli to a draw on the Crawford-Canelo undercard in September.",

            "content": "A British artist has transformed her terraced home in Devon into a sprawling, immersive artwork, which is now on the market with a guide price of £2 million. Emily Powell, 35, has meticulously hand-painted every surface of her five-bedroom property in Brixham, from light switches and floorboards to bath tiles and the fridge, creating a unique, lived-in masterpiece. The two-floor residence encompasses approximately 400 square metres of deeply personal works, flowing seamlessly together to form one continuous, walk-in painting. Visitors will discover fishing boats bobbing along the skirting board in the hallway, a kitchen table set with painted plates and a teapot, and a cupboard under the stairs reimagined as a swimming pool complete with a ladder. Birds are depicted in flight throughout the home, adding to the whimsical atmosphere. Each room is designed to evoke distinct emotions. The comforting red lounge features fireplace tiles adorned with family memories, while a circus-themed playroom bursts with animals wearing party hats. The upstairs hallway, leading to the master bedroom, showcases giant sunflowers, a nod to Powell’s residency on the Isles of Scilly this summer. In her young child’s room, giant tigers stand guard, offering a sense of protection. Powell, who grew up in Liverpool, is hosting a series of open-house tours before the property’s sale, with around 400 members of the public expected to experience the installation this week. She has also pledged to return to the house every 10 years for the rest of her life to carry out retouching, ensuring the artwork’s preservation. The sale includes an additional 65 pieces Powell has produced over the past decade, alongside 20 items of painted furniture, ranging from the fridge and freezer to bookcases, a bin store, and a playhouse. \"It took us so long to be able to buy our first house, which was completely bought with painting money from my pieces over the past 10 years,\" said Powell, who lives with her husband, young child, and cat. \"When we got here, we had been in rented accommodation for so long. It was such a special moment. I thought we would have beautiful carpets and polished ornaments but that didn’t happen at all.\" She explained how the artistic transformation began organically. \"I think it was a couple of weeks before I decided to paint a tree on the back of the office door, then it grew really quickly,\" she added. \"It has become a journey through different parts of my life. Each room has colour palettes to support your emotions.\" The artwork is deeply personal, incorporating elements such as \"birds flying in memory of my late father and different scenes from my life, from the Arctic and Lake District to the Inner Hebrides of Scotland.\" Powell noted, \"When you walk into the house, on the doormat there is an homage to Matisse and artists who painted still life pieces of the home.\" Powell created the extensive works using five-litre tins of house paint, applied with a selection of brushes from her local hardware store. She described how motherhood provided her with time at home, particularly in the evenings, to pick up a paintbrush and create new pieces inspired by moments from her life. \"When you live inside one giant painting, there are so many angles you have to consider and colour combinations that shift through doorways or up the stairs,\" she said. Tickets for the open-house tours sold out within 24 hours, with more than 500 people now on a waiting list. Visitors are travelling from as far as the United States and Europe for the tours, during which Powell’s kitchen will be transformed into a tea room, serving cake from Devon company High Tide Tea. \"I’ve had so many requests over the years to open the house up,\" Powell stated. \"I felt like I have finally finished it. We’ve chosen to put it on the market because it’s really important to me that this entire chapter is preserved. I don’t want to paint over what’s already here, I need to start a new chapter. This is an opportunity for people to have an entire capsule of art.\" Powell currently has no specific plans for after her family home is sold through international estate agents Chestertons, but expressed excitement for \"new walls to paint.\" The property listing highlights its unique nature: \"Spanning 1, 712sq ft across three floors, the five-bedroom, mid-terraced house effectively functions as a single, continuous canvas. It is one of the first known instances in the UK of a lived-in home, hand-painted in its entirety by the artist being offered for sale as a complete, immersive artwork.\" Riccardo Carrelli, handling the sale for Chestertons, described it as a \"fusion\" of art and property, adding that \"The collection is a significant art investment at an early stage in the artist’s career.\" He confirmed that viewings for potential buyers would be arranged outside of the public open-house tours. The £2 million guide price reflects the combined value of the home, its original artworks, and the included painted furniture.",

            "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) Pete Hegseth barely squeaked through a grueling Senate confirmation process to become secretary of defense earlier this year, facing lawmakers wary of the Fox News Channel host and skeptical of his capacity, temperament and fitness for the job. Just three months later, he quickly became pending military strikes in Yemen. And now, in what may be his most career-defining moment yet, Hegseth is confronting questions about the use of military force after a special operations team reportedly attacked survivors of a strike on an alleged drug boat off the coast of Venezuela. Some lawmakers and legal experts say the second strike would have violated the laws of armed conflict. “These are serious charges, and that’s the reason we’re going to have special oversight,” said Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi, the Republican chair of the Senate Armed Services Committee. The scrutiny surrounding Hegseth’s brash leadership style is surfacing what has been long-building discontent in Congress over President Donald Trump’s choice to helm the U. S. military. And it’s posing a potentially existential moment for Hegseth as the congressional committees overseeing the military launch an investigation amid mounting calls from Democratic senators for his resignation. Hegseth vowed a ‘warrior culture,’ but lawmakers take issue Since working to become defense secretary, Hegseth has vowed to bring a “warrior culture” to the U. S. government’s most powerful and expensive department, from rebranding it as the Department of War to essentially discarding the rules that govern how soldiers conduct themselves when lives are on the line. Hegseth on Tuesday cited the “fog of war” in defending the follow-up strike, saying that there were explosions and fire and that he did not see survivors in the water when the second strike was ordered and launched. He chided those second-guessing his actions as being part of the problem. Yet the approach to the operation was in line with the direction of the military under Hegseth, a former infantry officer with the Army National Guard, part of the post-Sept. 11 generation, who was deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan and earned Bronze Stars. During a speech in September, he told an unusual gathering of top military brass whom he had summoned from all corners of the globe to the Quantico Marine Corps Base in Virginia that they should not “fight with stupid rules of engagement.” “We untie the hands of our warfighters to intimidate, demoralize, hunt and kill the enemies of our country,” he said. “No more politically correct and overbearing rules of engagement, just common sense, maximum lethality and authority for warfighters.” But now lawmakers and military and legal experts say the Sept. 2 attack borders on illegal military action. “Somebody made a horrible decision. Somebody needs to be held accountable,” said Sen. Thom Tillis, a North Carolina Republican who in January held out support for Hegseth until only moments before casting a crucial vote for his confirmation. “Secretary Talk Show Host may have been experiencing the ‘fog of war,’ but that doesn’t change the fact that this was an extrajudicial killing amounting to murder or a war crime,” said Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md. “He must resign.” Rep. Don Bacon, a Republican who served 30 years active duty in the Air Force, finishing his career at the rank of brigadier general, said he hasn’t been a fan of Hegseth’s leadership. “I don’t think he was up to the task,” Bacon said. Will Hegseth keep Trump’s support? Trump, a Republican, has largely stood by his defense secretary, among the most important Cabinet-level positions. But the decisions by Wicker, alongside House Armed Services Chair Mike Rogers of Alabama and the top Democrats on the committees, to open investigations provide a rare moment of Congress asserting itself and its authority to conduct oversight of the Trump administration. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S. D., who shepherded the defense secretary’s nomination to confirmation, has said the boat strikes are within Trump’s authority as commander in chief and he noted that Hegseth serves at the pleasure of the president. “I don’t have, at this point, an evaluation of the secretary,” Thune said at the start of the week. “Others can make those evaluations.” But Hegseth also has strong allies on Capitol Hill, and it remains unclear how much Republicans would actually be willing to push back on the president, especially when they have spent the first year in his administration yielding to his various demands. Vice President JD Vance, who cast a rare tiebreaking vote to confirm Hegseth, has vigorously defended him in the attack. And Sen. Eric Schmitt, another close ally to Trump, dismissed criticism of Hegseth as “nonsense” and part of an effort to undermine Trump’s focus on Central and South America. “He’s not part of the Washington elite,” said Schmitt, R-Mo. “He’s not a think tanker that people thought Trump was going to pick. And so, for that reason and others, they just, they don’t like him.” Tension between some Republican lawmakers and the Pentagon has been rising for months. Capitol Hill has been angered by recent moves to restrict how defense officials communicate with lawmakers and the slow pace of information on Trump’s campaign to destroy boats carrying drugs off the coast of Venezuela. As he defends his job, Hegseth has spoken to both Wicker and Rogers, the top lawmakers overseeing the military. Rogers said he was “satisfied” with Hegseth after that conversation, while Wicker said that he told Hegseth that he would like him to testify to Congress. Hegseth at first tried to brush aside the initial report about the strike by posting a photo of the cartoon character Franklin the Turtle firing on a boat from a helicopter, but that only inflamed criticism of him and angered lawmakers who felt he was not taking the allegations seriously. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York called Hegseth a “national embarrassment,” adding the defense secretary’s social media post of the cartoon turtle is “something no serious leader would ever think of doing.” What information will Congress get? Later this week, the chairs of the armed services committees, along with the top Democrats on the committees, will hear private testimony from Navy Vice Adm. Frank “Mitch” Bradley, who the White House has said ordered the second strike on the survivors. Republicans have been careful to withhold judgment on the strike until they complete their investigation, but Democrats say that these problems with Hegseth were a long time coming. Sen. Tim Kaine, a Virginia Democrat, pointed back to Hegseth’s tumultuous confirmation hearing, at which issues were raised with his management of nonprofits, as well as allegations of a sexual assault and abuse, and drinking on the job. Hegseth had vowed not to consume alcohol if confirmed. “You don’t suddenly change your judgment level or change your character when you get confirmed to be secretary of defense,” Kaine said. “Instead, the things that have been part of your character just become much more dire and existential.” ___ Follow the AP’s coverage of Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth at.",

            "creator": "BBC News",
            "content": "The Scottish Human Rights Commission (SHRC) has described the investigation of deaths in custody as \"traumatising\" for families and warned that an increase in fatalities was \"unacceptable\". Alongside the charity Inquest, the commission spoke to 33 grieving relatives in a bid to improve the fatal accident inquiry (FAI) system in Scotland. FAIs investigate deaths in custody as well as other fatalities, and consider what went wrong and what can be learned from the incident. Justice Secretary Angela Constance said the Scottish government would fully consider the recommendations. The government set up the review in January following a previous report from the SHRC which criticised a lack of action on reducing deaths in state custody in Scotland. The new report has been submitted to Sheriff Principal Ian Abercrombie, who is chairing the review. 'People blaming each other' Stuart Allan, whose daughter Katie took her own life in Polmont Young Offenders institution in 2018, said the FAI process was \"very traumatising\" for his family. Katie was found dead in her cell three months into a 16-month sentence for dangerous and drink driving following a hit-and-run. \"It took us six years for the FAI to actually start and that is a long time when you're a family that's grieving and waiting for answers,\" Mr Allan told Radio Scotland Breakfast. He said the process was \"harrowing\" and \"retraumatised\" the family as they went through the details of his daughter's death. The court process often felt like people were \"blaming each other\", he said, with lots of legal representation at the hearings for the various organisations. \"Whereas the FAI is really a process about learning, about finding out what went wrong and how to improve it,\" he added. Following the inquiry, the sheriff ruled that a \"multiple failures\" within the system led to Katie Allan's death. Mr Allan said his family were \"buoyant\" that the Scottish government had accepted the recommendations of the report and taken action to improve their suicide prevention strategy. \"The grief never goes away,\" he added. \"It's always there with you. \"Katie's not going to come back, no matter how many changes they make. We've learnt to live with our grief. \"We still want to do some campaigning, we still want to make sure that the people who have made those promises are held responsible.\" 'We tried to warn them' The report heard from grieving families who recalled their experiences during a \"listening day\". They said that potential risks to life were ignored, that the cause of death was given and then retracted, and that one person was referred to as \"the body\". The report included an account of prison officers eating a packed lunch on a hospital bed containing the body of a prisoner, of belongings being wrongly attributed, and of one family being given three different causes of death. One parent said: \"It feels like you are the one on trial.\" Another relative said they had little reassurance of the prevention of future deaths, and added: \"Six years of fighting. what difference has it made?\" Another family member said: \"We tried to warn them. four hours later we got the call saying he was dead.\" One person said: \"It felt like they were looking for things to blame on our relative.\" The report suggested improvements including guaranteed legal representation, trauma-informed practice, legally enforced time-scales, and co-ordinated communication after a death. It also suggested specialist sheriffs for deaths in custody, and an independent oversight of FAI recommendations. The report said: \"It has become increasingly clear to the SHRC that Scotland's FAI system must be significantly and quickly reformed. \"Several families recounted interactions that felt rude, abrupt, or even hostile and accusatory which further eroded trust.\" Examples of good practice were included, but the report said: \"They were described as rare exceptions within a broader landscape of confusion, silence and neglect.\" 'Deaths are rising' Prof Angela O'Hagan, who chairs the SHRC, said the system would only be improved if decision-makers listened to the experiences of families who went through FAIs. She added: \"Scotland has a very high rate of deaths in its places of detention, and these deaths are rising. This is unacceptable and is a grave human rights concern.\" Deborah Coles, executive director of Inquest, said the report should be a \"wake-up call\" for \"fundamental reform\" of the system. \"Families describe the legal process after a death as being another layer of harm, extending their grief for years,\" she added. Justice Secretary Angela Constance said she recognised the impact a death in custody had on families, as well as the concerns families raised about FAIs. She added: \"That is why we have established an independent review to consider the efficiency, effectiveness and trauma-informed nature of how FAIs deal with these cases. \"As part of this work, Sheriff Principal Abercrombie attended the family listening day to hear directly from bereaved families. \"The review is examining evidence from a wide range of sources, including the experiences of families, to identify the barriers they face in engaging with the process and the timescales involved.\" A spokesperson for the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service said: \"We understand the distress that investigating the death of a loved one can cause for grieving families. \"We recognise that more can be done across the whole justice system to improve how deaths are investigated, and we will continue to work closely with our partners to drive those improvements.\".",

            "content": "Exeter director of rugby Rob Baxter says the postponement of proposed global franchise league R360 is positive for the Prem. The new league was set to start next year, but has been put back until at least 2028. Most global unions and the British & Irish Lions had said players taking part in the event would not be eligible to play internationally. R360 had hoped to launch an inaugural event in October 2026, with eight men's sides and four women's teams, but had been put under pressure by organisers' failure to secure sanctioning from World Rugby. \"We want the best players playing in England, in the English clubs, keeping our competition as strong as possible,\" Baxter told BBC Sport. \"So from my perspective, I've got to say it's positive news for us as a Premiership club, playing in the Premiership. \"I think the majority of us involved in the sport to a relatively high level were getting the feeling from more than one source that it was going to be a struggle for them to to take off now. \"A lot of us had an expectation this [postponement] was going to happen and probably had done for a couple of months, so it probably didn't come into our planning as much as other people probably think it did.\".",

Shares in the FTSE 100 firm dropped 4% in Wednesday trading after Qatar’s sovereign wealth fund said it planned to cut its stake by nearly 4%, down from 10. 5% currently to 6. 8%. The stake sale means Qatar’s sovereign wealth fund will no longer be the biggest investor in Sainsbury’s for the first time since 2007, with Royal Mail owner, Czech billionaire Daniel Kretinsky, instead becoming its largest shareholder. Qatar Investment Authority (QIA) said after market close on Tuesday that it plans to sell up to 98 million ordinary shares in Sainsbury’s, but gave no reason for the sale. It follows a recent jump in Sainsbury’s shares, which are up by nearly a quarter so far this year. The QIA’s stake peaked at 25% in 2007 the year the group also ditched a potential takeover bid for the retail giant. It has been selling down its stake since 2021. Sainsbury’s recently upgraded its annual outlook, saying it is now set for retail earnings of more than £1 billion after a better-than-expected half-year performance. The UK’s second largest grocer, which also owns the Argos chain, reported an underlying operating profit of £504 million for the 28 weeks to September 13, up slightly on last year’s £503 million and better than the group had forecast.",

            "content": "The Trump administration is pausing all immigration applications such as requests for green cards for people from 19 countries banned from travel earlier this year, as part of sweeping immigration changes in the wake of the shooting of two National Guard troops. The changes were outlined in a policy memo posted Tuesday on the website of U. S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, the agency tasked with processing and approving all requests for immigration benefits. The pause puts on hold a wide range of immigration-related decisions such as green card applications or naturalizations for immigrants from those 19 countries that the Trump administration has described as high-risk. It's up to the agency's director, Joseph Edlow, on when to lift the pause, the memo said. The administration in June banned travel to the U. S. by citizens of 12 countries and restricted access for those from seven others, citing national security concerns. The ban applied to citizens of Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, the Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen while the restricted access applied to people from Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela. At the time, no action was taken against immigrants from those countries who were already in the U. S. before the travel ban went into effect. But now the news from USCIS means those people already in the U. S. regardless of when they arrived will come under extra scrutiny. The agency said it would conduct a comprehensive review of all \"approved benefit requests\" for immigrants who entered the country during the Biden administration. The agency cited the shooting of two National Guard troops by a suspect who is an Afghan national as a reason for the pause and heightened scrutiny for people from those countries. One National Guard soldier was killed and another wounded in the Thanksgiving week shooting near the White House. \"In light of identified concerns and the threat to the American people, USCIS has determined that a comprehensive re-review, potential interview, and re-interview of all aliens from high-risk countries of concern who entered the United States on or after January 20, 2021 is necessary,\" the agency said. The agency said in the Tuesday memo that within 90 days it would create a prioritized list of immigrants for review and if necessary, referral to immigration enforcement or other law enforcement agencies. Since the shooting, the administration has announced a flurry of decisions it was taking to scrutinize immigrants already in the country and those seeking to come to the U. S. Last week, the director of USCIS said in a social media post that his agency would be reexamining green card applications for people from countries \"of concern.\" But the policy directive Tuesday goes further and lays out in more detail the scope of who will be affected. USCIS also said last week that it was pausing all asylum decisions, and the State Department said it was halting visas for Afghans who assisted the U. S. war effort. Days before the shooting, USCIS said in a separate memo that the administration would review the cases of all refugees who entered the U. S. during the Biden administration.

            "content": "A nursery worker has pleaded guilty to 26 serious sexual offences against children. Vincent Chan, 45, of Finchley, worked at a nursery in north London between 2017 and 2024. The offences include five counts of sexual assault of a child by penetration, four counts of sexual assault of a child by touching, 11 counts of taking indecent photographs or pseudo-photographs of a child, and six counts of making indecent photographs or pseudo-photographs of a child. The latter offences involved images across categories A, B, and C, with category A depicting the most severe abuse. Detective Superintendent Lewis Basford, who led the Metropolitan Police's investigation, said: Child sexual abuse is one of the most horrific crimes imaginable, and Chan’s offending spanned years, revealing a calculated and predatory pattern of abuse. \"He infiltrated environments that should have been safe havens for children, exploiting the trust of families and the wider community to conceal his actions and prey on the most vulnerable.\" The nursery where the offending took place is no longer operating at this location. This breaking news story is being updated and more details will be published shortly. Please refresh the page for the latest version.",

            "content": "Prince William and Kate Middleton have welcomed the German president and his wife to the UK for a state visit, The Prince and Princess of Wales carried out their customary duty on behalf of King Charles at Heathrow Airport on Wednesday morning at the start of Frank-Walter Steinmeier and Elke Budenbender’s state visit. It is the first state visit to the UK by a German president in 27 years, and the fifth since 1958. It comes after the King and Queen undertook a state visit to Germany in 2023. A carpet lining party, formed of The King’s Colour Squadron, Royal Air Force, was in position on Wednesday for the arrival of the president’s Bundesrepublik Deutschland plane which featured a stripe made of the colours of the German flag. Dressed in a suit, William greeted the King’s guests alongside Kate, who was wearing a Burberry dress with a blue coat by Sarah Burton for Alexander McQueen, with a matching hat, her hair down and straight, and earrings which belonged to William’s late mother Diana, Princess of Wales, and a Prince of Wales Feathers Brooch. The royal couple shook hands with the president and his wife, with Ms Budenbender bringing her hand to her chest as she smiled and chatted with Kate. Also waiting at the airport in west London was a welcome party which included Metropolitan Police deputy commissioner Matt Jukes and the British ambassador to Germany Andrew Mitchell. Mr Steinmeier and Ms Budenbender will then be accompanied to Windsor, where they will be formally welcomed by Charles and Camilla on an open-air royal dais in the centre of the Berkshire town, before enjoying a carriage ride through the streets, past the crowds, to the castle to kick off their three-day stay. Mr Steinmeier will go on to receive a ceremonial welcome in the castle quadrangle, attended by the King, Camilla, William and Kate, and be feted with a grand state banquet in the historic royal residence’s St George’s Hall on Wednesday evening. On Thursday morning, he will privately lay flowers at the tomb of the late Queen Elizabeth II in the castle’s St George’s Chapel, before joining the King and Queen for a Big Help Out reception to showcase the impact volunteering can have on communities. Before a formal farewell, they will be shown the State Sleigh, which was designed by Queen Victoria’s German-born husband, Prince Albert and recorded in Victoria’s diary in 1845.",

            "content": "Watch live as Sir Keir Starmer faces a grilling over the Budget at Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday (3 December). The prime minister defended Rachel Reeves in a speech on Monday, after she was accused of misleading the public by lying about economic forecasts she had received to justify her £26bn worth of tax hikes. It has emerged that before her speech, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) told her that the public’s finances had significantly improved and that, instead of a deficit, she had a surplus of £4. 2bn. Backing Ms Reeves, who has denied that she lied, the PM said the Budget was a “moment of personal pride”. Sir Keir may also be challenged on the reforms to the justice system announced on Tuesday (2 December), which would see juries scrapped in so-called either-way cases that have a likely jail time of three years or less. It comes as Justice Secretary David Lammy revealed that 12 prisoners have been mistakenly released in the past three weeks, two of whom are still at large. The PM may also be grilled on a newly released report finding failures in the collapse of the China spy trial. A parliamentary inquiry said that \"systematic failures\" led to the Chinese spy case collapsing.",

The 27-year-old right-hander is in agreement with the Los Angeles Angels on a one-year, $1. 95-million contract, ESPN’s Jeff Passan reported on Tuesday. It is a fully guaranteed major league deal, Passan added. Manoah was designated for assignment by the Toronto Blue Jays on Sept. 23 as a corresponding move when Anthony Santander was activated off the injured list. The former Cy Young finalist was then claimed by the Atlanta Braves, who declined to tender him a contract on the Nov. 21 deadline. Manoah had spent his entire professional career with the Blue Jays, who drafted the Florida native 11th overall in 2019. He reached the majors in 2021 and was a rising star in 2022, when he made the AL All-Star team and finished third in the Cy Young Award voting while going 16-7 with a 2. 24 ERA and 180 strikeouts. But Manoah had a miserable start to 2023, eventually getting sent to the minors to fix control issues. He made five starts for the Jays in 2024 before he was sidelined by surgery. Manoah last pitched in the major leagues during the 2024 season, recording a 3. 70 ERA, striking out 26 and walking eight over 24. 1 innings spread out across five starts in May. After experiencing a pinching sensation in his elbow in his final start that season, Manoah required surgery on his ulnar collateral ligament and underwent a hybrid Tommy John procedure, replacing the ligament and anchoring the new one with an internal brace suture. Manoah spent the rest of the 2024 season and most of 2025 recovering from the procedure, eventually logging 38. 2 innings across four minor league levels while rehabbing in the Blue Jays organization. He pitched to a 3. 96 ERA with 35 strikeouts and 23 walks in 2025. Los Angeles just added respected pitching coach Mike Maddux to new manager Kurt Suzuki’s staff, and Manoah is the second once-promising starter recovering from major injury to join the Angels in the offseason. Last month, Los Angeles acquired former top prospect Grayson Rodriguez from Baltimore in a trade for outfielder Taylor Ward, betting that Maddux and the Angels’ staff can help Rodriguez to fulfill his considerable potential. Rodriguez and Manoah didn’t pitch in the majors at all in 2025, but they’ll both hope to be in the running for a spot in the Angels’ rotation in 2026. Manoah’s control problems in 2023 had a direct effect on the Angels: He hit Ward in the face with a fastball that July, ending the slugger’s season.",

George Forbes and Alistair Buchan, who were both 77, died following the incident in 2021. It happened in the Aberdeenshire town's Merchant Street, near St Peter's Church. The Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service (COPFS) said it had now been decided there would be no proceedings in the case. The incident happened on the afternoon of 18 August 2021, and emergency services were called to the scene. Mr Forbes was pronounced dead at the scene while Mr Buchan was taken to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary, but later also died. The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) investigated, and reported to the procurator fiscal. The COPFS said: \"After careful consideration of the facts and circumstances of the case, including the available admissible evidence, Crown counsel instructed that there should be no proceedings taken at this time.\" A statement added: \"The Crown reserves the right to proceed in the future should further evidence become available.\".",

            "content": "A woman who had a major operation cancelled amid days-long water outages in a Kent town has hit out at utilities bosses for letting down “vulnerable” people. Jessie Wilson, 47, was due to have a hysterectomy at the Nuffield Health Tunbridge Wells Hospital on Tuesday. But at the last minute, her procedure was cancelled after water provider South East Water (SEW) confirmed the outages would spill over into a fourth day. It comes after an issue at a treatment works forced SEW to turn off the taps for up to 24, 000 customers in Tunbridge Wells, Pembury, Frant and Eridge on Saturday. The shutdown has seen schools and businesses unable to open and left thousands reliant on local water stations. Nuffield Health confirmed its hospital in Tunbridge Wells had also been impacted by the water outage, with non-urgent procedures being postponed. Ms Wilson told The Independent she will now have to have the operation just days before Christmas, which is likely to leave her bed-bound over the festive period. She slammed SEW for “overpromising” and leaving residents scrambling. “I don’t want to be one-week post surgery on Christmas Day, but not I’ve got absolutely no choice,” she said. “I’m a single mum with a 16-year-old autistic teen and I feel bad for her more than anything because her Christmas is not going to be the best.” Ms Wilson only discovered she would need the operation around four weeks ago following an initial scan. She said she has spent the last week “mentally preparing” for the procedure, only for it to be cancelled at the eleventh hour due constantly shifting estimates from SEW. “I had an appointment with my consultant at around 12: 30 on Monday and we both thought it would still be going ahead,” she said, citing SEW’s guidance at the time which had advised water should be restored by 8pm that evening. But her hopes were dashed when she received a call at around 4pm, cancelling the procedure as the water wouldn’t be back in time. While she believes the hospital has its own tanks to provide for current patients, she believes it did not want to take on new patients due to the shortage. Ms Wilson acknowledged the situation was out of the hospital’s control, but said that knowing she will have to prepare to go through the operation all over again is the “biggest thing”. “I wish SEW had been a little bit more realistic with the timings,” she said. “Someone should have been able to do some rough calculations you shouldn’t overpromise.” Ms Wilson is a resident of Tunbridge Wells herself, and has been living without a water supply in her own home since Saturday evening, a situation she said has “not been easy”. She has been forced to wash her face and hands in the sinks at her daughter’s school five miles away, and has resorted to throwing buckets of water down her toilet in an attempt to flush waste. But she said she was mostly concerned about elderly and vulnerable people who may be suffering alone without access to water. “I don’t want to complain too much, people have it far worse than we do,” she said. “There must be elderly people who are in a vulnerable state who don’t necessarily have family nearby. “It’s not beyond the realms of possibility to think there might be people not surviving this.” On Tuesday, Age UK Tunbridge Wells issued an appeal for any spare bottles of water that could go to help vulnerable clients. Chief executive Sandra Springett told The Independent the charity had been forced to cancel its day care service on Monday as its building had been left with no running water, but it had managed to resume operations on Tuesday. She added staff had also been out delivering hot meals and checking on vulnerable residents despite the difficult circumstances. “Fortunately, the majority of people we have contacted are being supported by their neighbours, friends and family and other independent organisation like us stepping in as needed,” she said. But Ms Springett added the problem is “not really resolved with a six pack of mineral water”. “Kettles need filling, toilet cisterns need filling and manhandling big bottles of water is not easy for everyone,” she continued. “The disruption to daily routines cannot be underestimated, especially for older people who usually try to soldier on independently.” SEW said following a recurrence of the water quality issues that caused the shutdown, it was now “very unlikely” to be able to reintroduce supplies on Tuesday to all customers currently without water. It added it had opened a number of bottled water stations and said staff are “continuing to deliver bottled water to more than 2, 000 of our most vulnerable customers on our PSR register”. “We are continuing to move water around our network and have tankered more than 6. 5 million litres of water into the town to keep as many customers in supply as possible and have handed out more than 400, 000 litres of bottled water,” it added. A Nuffield Hospital spokesperson said: “We can confirm a water outage affecting the Tunbridge Wells area, which is outside of our control and has impacted supply to our hospital. “As a precaution, we have rescheduled non-urgent procedures to conserve back-up water reserves for essential care only. We are working closely with local authorities and await updates on resolution.\".",

            "content": "The draw for the largest Rugby World Cup in history is set to be made with all 24 qualified nations finding out their fate for the tournament in Australia. The 2027 edition has been expanded by four teams as rugby’s signature event heads Down Under for the first time since England’s triumph in 2003. Could Steve Borthwick’s side follow in the footsteps of Martin Johnson, Jonny Wilkinson and co.? After an encouraging 2025, they appear to be heading in the right direction though it will take some team to stop South Africa from completing a three-peat if the Springboks continue on their current trajectory. A 24-team tournament brings a revamped format with six pools of four sides to be drawn, and a round of 16 introduced. With some third-placed sides progressing, a favourable draw could be key to a nation’s chances of going deep in two years’ time.",

The Mission continued sustained engagement with the host authorities, conducted regular prison visits, and provided legal support to ensure due process.

            "content": "New Delhi: The deadline for the third instalment of advance tax for the financial year 2025-26 is just around the corner, December 15. If you miss this crucial date, be prepared for possible interest and penalties under the Income Tax Act, 1961. For those unfamiliar, advance tax is nothing but paying your income tax in parts throughout the year instead of waiting to clear the entire amount while filing your income tax return. Paying on time helps you avoid last-minute stress and financial burden. How does advance tax work? Advance tax is mandatory for anyone whose total tax payable for the year after adjusting TDS comes to Rs 10, 000 or more. Instead of paying it all at once, the amount is divided into four instalments across the financial year: 15 per cent by June 15, 45 per cent by September 15, 75 per cent by December 15, and 100 per cent by March 15. This means that by the upcoming December 15 deadline, taxpayers should have already paid at least three-quarters of their estimated annual tax. This system ensures smoother payments throughout the year and helps avoid a heavy tax load at the end. Who is required to pay advance tax? Advance tax isn’t limited to big corporations or high earners, anyone with taxable income not fully covered by TDS must pay it. This includes: Salaried individuals who earn extra income through rent, interest, freelance work, or capital gains Self-employed professionals such as doctors, lawyers, consultants, CAs, and freelancers Business owners and traders, including small and medium businesses Investors earning taxable income from stocks, mutual funds, F&O, debt instruments, or crypto Many salaried people assume that the TDS deducted by their employer takes care of their entire tax liability. But if you earn anything beyond your salary, you are responsible for declaring that income and paying advance tax on it. Who doesn’t have to pay advance tax? Not everyone falls under the advance tax requirement. You are exempt if: Your total tax payable after TDS deductions is less than Rs 10, 000 You are a resident senior citizen aged 60 or above and do not have any business or professional income All your income is already covered by TDS, with no extra earnings that need self-declaration In these cases, you don’t need to make advance tax payments. How can you calculate and pay advance tax? To figure out your advance tax amount you should start by estimating your total income for the financial year. Deduct any eligible tax-saving deductions, apply the relevant income tax slab rates, and calculate your total tax liability. Then subtract the TDS already deducted. If the amount still due is Rs 10, 000 or more, you are required to pay advance tax. Paying is simple and can be done online through Challan 280 on the Income Tax e-filing portal. This helps you stay compliant without any last-minute rush. Why paying advance tax on time matters Ignoring advance tax deadlines, especially the December 15 installment can cost you more than you expect. If you miss the date or underpay, you may face interest penalties under Sections 234B and 234C of the Income Tax Act. This can become expensive, particularly for those with fluctuating incomes like freelancers, consultants, and traders. Paying advance tax on time helps you manage your cash flow better, reduces year-end pressure, and prevents unnecessary penalties. By spreading your tax payments across the year, you avoid last-minute financial stress and stay on the right side of tax compliance.",

The business said it will be affected by an upcoming tax shake-up, which will see properties worth more than £500, 000 taxed at higher rates. Big Yellow said 27 of its stores will be affected by the change. It told investors that it was expecting its annual rates bill for the next tax year, beginning in April 2026, to be almost £23 million, up by £1. 8 million from its current bill. The firm said it was appealing the rateable values of some of its stores. Big Yellow operates self-storage units from 111 locations in England, Scotland and Wales. In last week’s autumn Budget, Chancellor Rachel Reeves confirmed that a new business rates system will be introduced from the next financial year. This will see rates multipliers lowered for retail, hospitality and leisure firms funded by higher rates on larger commercial properties, including warehouses. The Treasury said the move was designed to “rebalance the business rates system” and help smaller firms by putting more of the tax burden onto bigger operators.",

He later died in hospital and West Mercia Police has since confirmed five men have been arrested on suspicion of murder and bailed. One of Mr Kumar's relatives, Jitender Tarar, said the family was \"in constant touch\" with authorities in an attempt to get the body back to India. He said: \"The family is trying to process it but they will be able to process it when they see Vijay and they can say goodbye to Vijay in front of their own eyes. \"We certainly want [him] back as soon as possible. In our culture, the formal process of mourning starts after cremating the body. \"After cremation, for around 12 days, the family sits together and all of the relatives visit the family to provide comfort, to provide solace but this is [a] very extraordinary situation. \"We know a family member is dead but we don't know when to start the mourning.\" Mr Tarar added: \"When his mother was told about the death she was literally fainting and she had to be taken to hospital. \"It's been really difficult to process it. Living without him, I would say we wouldn't have imagined it in our worst nightmares. \"Literally, we were so shocked and now we are trying to cope with this harsh reality.\".",

While the Union Minister of Telecommunications explained that the usage of the app is on a voluntary basis and can be uninstalled at will, the debate illuminates the fundamental dilemma we face worldwide: balancing security of the citizens against their right to privacy. Below is a comparative study of how developed nations handle cyber fraud, tracing their methodologies from mandated state software to advanced AI defenses. State Control Vs. Digital Dictation: Russia And China Two major powers have opted for highly centralised, state-controlled models for digital security and citizen oversight: Russia: The government requires all phones and tablets to come pre-installed with 19 \"necessary software\" apps. Among them are a state ID app, Gosuslugi, and a new MAX \"super app\" that is supposed to substitute Western messaging services like WhatsApp and Telegram. According to Russia's government, such measures are crucial for safeguarding the country against possible cyber attacks. China: The country uses the world's most extensive state-controlled model, mainly through the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) and the Ministry of Public Security (MPS). The Chinese system depends on the \"Great Firewall,\" a huge technical screening that prevents suspicious domains, phishing pages, and unauthorized financial websites from reaching users. Digital services must go through strict verification, wherein face and ID matching for SIM cards, bank accounts, and payment applications such as WeChat Pay and Alipay are required. Multi-Layered Defense: US And UK Models Both the United States and the United Kingdom use multi-tiered approaches relying on collaboration between government agencies, financial institutions, and the public. United States: The system is spearheaded by the Internet Crime Complaint Center, IC3, operated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which acts as a central hub for reporting cyber crimes like phishing and identity theft. The Federal Trade Commission penalises these scammers and protects consumer interests, and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, CISA, provides real-time threat intelligence and emergency aid. CISA also operates EINSTEIN, a protective intrusion detection and prevention system securing federal networks. UK: The NCSC runs a programme of ACD, which automatically scans government websites for weaknesses, blocks phishing emails, and takes down malicious websites. The UK also depends on a central National Fraud and Cyber Crime Reporting Centre. Most importantly, the UK banking system has sophisticated fraud detection, including the Confirmation of Payee (CoP) system, which checks the recipient's details before a transfer is made against those held for that account and issues warnings if they do not match. Optional Technology and Platform Accountability: Singapore and the EU and other developed regions put a high focus on user choice and the responsibility of large technology platforms for a secure digital environment. Singapore is a digitally advanced country that uses the optional ScamShield app. The new surveillance technology with AI and data analytics warns users against fraudulent calls, messages, or links in real time. The system is highly community-oriented since user reports are key in quickly detecting and neutralising new fraud patterns. European Union: The EU does not have compulsory applications but enforces \"security by design.\" The Cyber Resilience Act makes sure that every device sold in the EU receives all essential security updates and is secure from every platform layer. In addition, the Digital Services Act makes very large platforms-for example, Google, Meta, and TikTok-responsible for removing potential scam threats as quickly as possible, with the imposition of heavy fines. The EU also offers an optional, secure mobile app called the EUDI Wallet for verified digital documents.",

Trevor Daley, 55, was arrested near Bemboka on the Snowy Mountains Highway after he allegedly blew a . 18 breath test, which is around three-and-a-half times the legal limit. Daley is the driver for Police Minister Yasmin Catley and was bound to pick her up this morning for the opening of the new Bega Police Station. \"The circumstances are very concerning. It is illegal to drink and drive, and no one is above the law,\" Catley said. The Minister was not in the car at the time of the arrest. She had flown to Bega with the Police Commissioner, Mal Lanyon. She chose not to comment when asked if Daley remained her driver. Catley has been the Police Minister for more than two years, and each holiday season has been at the forefront of delivering warnings about drink driving. Daley told 9News he would not be making any comment. He is scheduled to face court just before Christmas. Available on theApple App StoreandGoogle Play.",

Jane Baker, manager at Newcastle-Staffs Foodbank in Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffordshire, said it urgently needed donations to continue helping those in need during the colder months. Her plea came as charity the Trussell Trust revealed more than 61, 000 emergency food parcels were delivered to people across the region between December 2024 and February 2025. Ms Baker said: \"We are bracing ourselves for another difficult winter and are urgently seeking the public's support so we can continue to help people facing hunger.\" Last winter saw a 27% increase in demand for food parcels compared to pre-pandemic levels, the charity said, and also included 22, 000 parcels for children, which was 19% more than in 2019/2020. \"We are seeing so many working families, carers, and pensioners walking through our doors,\" Ms Baker said. \"This isn't right.\" She said food banks were not the answer to the issue of food poverty but were a lifeline for thousands of people \"facing hunger and hardshipWe're determined to continue providing vital support this winter but we urgently need donations or we might not be here next year,\" she said. \"Donations are down, while costs are up. When people's shelves are empty, our food banks can't be.\" According to the Trussell Trust, food banks in the West Midlands spent an estimated £315, 000 on food as donations struggled to keep up with the demand. Sophie Carre, the charity's director of engagement at Trussell, said: \"Christmas should be a time of joy and celebration, but this winter too many people will be struggling just to get by. \"Tens of thousands of families will be forced to turn to a food bank for the first time as they are left exhausted, isolated and without enough money to live on.\".",

            "content": "NI's 'worst road' fixed as new scheme aims to tackle potholes 9 minutes ago Luke SprouleMid Ulster reporter, BBC News NI A road so bad that it was once known as the worst in Northern Ireland has finally reopened after a £160, 000 makeover. Ferry Road in County Tyrone used to have severe defects including a pothole so deep councillor Malachy Quinn could stand in it up to his hips. Quinn said the resurfacing scheme had made a huge difference to the lives of people who travelled along it regularly. Now, in a bid to more efficiently tackle potholes and other defects, the Department for Infrastructure (DfI) has announced a new mapping project which will survey every inch of Northern Ireland's road networks in minute detail. The head of Gaist, the company carrying out the survey, said it would give Northern Ireland \"the most understood road network in the world\" and would help to make repairs and maintenance more efficient. Quinn said the process to repair road defects was often laborious and that anything to make that easier was welcome. \"This took a lot of work and it's just not myself,\" he said. \"There's other councillors, there's other people being involved in it as well. \"Between meetings, on-site meetings at the council buildings, meetings with MLAs and eventually we got here. \"People just want a good service. It's like any other public service that people are providing. As long as things are getting fixed, people are happy.\" Quinn said potholes were one of the main issues he dealt with as a councillor. \"A never-ending story is probably the best way to put it, because we have fantastic work done here but if you go across my electoral area you're hitting defects all the time, you're hitting a lot of potholes. \"I could throw a stone here and probably hit another road and hit another pothole.\" What is the new digital mapping project? The new mapping scheme was announced at the launch of the DfI's draft road maintenance strategy on Tuesday. Speaking at the launch, echoing Quinn's comments, Infrastructure Minister Liz Kimmins said in her 12 years as an elected representative, the condition of the roads was probably \"the single biggest issue for people on a day-to-day basis\". In the past financial year the DfI spent £1. 15m compensating people for damage to their vehicles caused by road defects. Sinn Féin minister Kimmins said the digital road survey was a way of \"working smarter\" to tackle problems. \"The funding situation is still extremely challenging so this will use digital technology to look at the road condition, be able to get us real detailed data much quicker, with less resources required and help us to make more targeted decisions in terms of improving our road network,\" she said. \"For people on the ground, the most important thing is that they will see the tangible outcomes of this. \"I hope that we can see real improvements in the not so distant future.\" The mapping is carried out by cameras attached to survey vehicles travelling around the road network, capturing images as they travel and feeding back information on the state of the road surface. The vehicles in the mapping project look similar to a car that captures images for Google Street View, ordinary vehicles with cameras attached to their roofs. The data on the state of the surface can then be examined by engineers on desktop computers. This can then be used to decide what problems should be prioritised and what sort of maintenance should be carried out. Mapping is expected to be completed by April. Stephen Birdsall, chief executive of Gaist, said it meant work that previously would have required an engineer to drive around inspecting different parts of the network could now be done from an office. \"This is one of the most exciting projects we've ever undertaken,\" he said. \"We've done bigger projects in terms of surveying more roads, but actually this is an entire country that we're looking at here. \"We're going to be mapping every inch of what's out there. \"That will mean this will be the most understood road network, probably in the world. \"There'll be nothing that we won't know about the road network in terms of its condition, the rate that it's declining, where we need to put different treatments to get the best value for money.\".",

            "content": "The Post Office has issued essential guidance to those planning on sending cards and presents over Christmas this year, as it reveals which day will be its busiest of the season. An influx of mail is expected on 8 December this year, the Post Office said, forecasting that it will be its busiest day of the season. It has urged the public to post early to avoid the rush and ensure gifts arrive on time. The Post Office poll highlighted that 34 per cent of the population view sending Christmas parcels and cards as a cherished festive tradition. Despite this, only 33 per cent intend to post their items by early to mid-December, with a notable 8 per cent confessing they leave all their festive mailing until the final week before Christmas. The company has reminded customers that it also offers convenient drop-off and collection points for prepaid parcels, encompassing services from Royal Mail and Parcelforce, alongside Amazon, DPD, DHL, and Evri at selected locations. Postmaster Arif Matadar said: “Christmas is one of the most joyful times of year in our post offices. There’s nothing quite like seeing customers come through the door with parcels and cards, ready to spread some festive cheer to their loved ones. It really reminds me how much of a community hub we are. “As we want our customers making the most of the festivities, there are a few tips I’d recommend to help get organised and make your posting experience as smooth and stress-free as possible.” Mr Matadar recommended checking the latest posting dates, especially for international destinations, as these will vary depending on their destination. Ensuring addresses are written clearly and that a return address is added on the back also helps things go smoothly, he said. It is also advisable to opt for Royal Mail special delivery on items like cash or vouchers, Mr Matadar added, which offers full tracking and insurance cover. Royal Mail previously announced it would hire around 20, 000 temporary workers to boost delivery operations across the Christmas period. The new positions will be spread across two parcel hubs, four seasonal parcel sorting centres and 37 mail centres throughout the country. Latest UK posting dates for Christmas Wednesday 17 December Saturday 20 December Royal Mail Special Delivery Guaranteed Tuesday 23 December Royal Mail Tracked 24 Monday 22 December Royal Mail Tracked 48 Friday 19 December.",

            "content": "Erling Haaland brought up his century of Premier League goals as Manchester City survived a remarkable Fulham comeback in a madcap 5-4 win. Cristian Romero salvaged a point for Tottenham with a stoppage-time overhead kick in a 2-2 draw at Newcastle, while Jack Grealish’s strike lifted Everton to a 1-0 win at Bournemouth. England rounded off a memorable year, in which they won the Women’s Euro 2025, by beating a stubborn Ghana side 2-0 at St Mary’s in the final match of their homecoming series. Guardiola mystified by City collapse Pep Guardiola was at a loss to explain what happened to his Manchester City side after they almost blew a four-goal lead at Fulham. Erling Haaland became the quickest player to 100 Premier League goals when he opened the scoring as City established a 5-1 lead but goals from Alex Iwobi and substitute Samuel Chukwueze’s double left them clinging on for dear life by the end. “Did you enjoy that, guys?” a smiling Guardiola said after the match. “Me? Impossible. It’s just a question of survival. Don’t tell me how, the players don’t know either. At the end we take it. “It’s the Premier League, you can’t control, it’s the Premier League. I know you’re going to ask what happened, and I don’t have an answer.” Frank hails Romero as Tottenham hit back to hold Toon Tottenham boss Thomas Frank hailed a “top performance” from skipper Cristian Romero after his brace helped salvage a 2-2 draw against Newcastle. Bruno Guimaraes had put Newcastle ahead before Anthony Gordon’s penalty had restored their lead after Romero had levelled but the Argentina international had the final say with a remarkable overhead kick in added-on time. “I think that was the perfect bicycle kick, hit with the shin, aiming for the bottom corner,” Frank said. “I think he deserves that. A top performance defending. On the ball: coolness, calmness, duels, then get up there and score two goals.” Moyes happy Everton are back on track Everton manager David Moyes believes the Toffees’ hard-fought 1-0 win at Bournemouth proved Saturday’s 4-1 humbling at home to Newcastle was just a blip. England international Jack Grealish’s 78th-minute goal was enough to earn Everton their third win in four Premier League games. Moyes said: “That is three wins out of four and we’ve kept three clean sheets as well. We didn’t play well against Newcastle but we’ve just got a win at Old Trafford and come here and got another three points on the road.” Kendall takes the cake for Wiegman England manager Sarina Wiegman hailed a “special moment” for Lucia Kendall after she marked her second international start with a goal in a 2-0 win over Ghana. Aston Villa midfielder Kendall bagged her first international goal after six minutes at St Mary’s, where she started her career at Southampton, before Alessia Russo’s stoppage-time penalty helped the European champions round off a memorable 2025 with a routine victory. “She was really alert,” said Wiegman of Kendall’s close-range finish. “She was so happy. How she celebrated as if she’d won the Champions League. “It was a fun moment, a special moment. It’s her home. She shows consistency and that’s not easy when you’ve just come into this environment. Things have gone so quickly. She keeps up her levels and shows that she’s a good player.” Woods OK after on-air collapse Television presenter Laura Woods says she is “OK” after collapsing live on air during ITV’s build-up to England’s friendly against Ghana on Tuesday evening. Woods was leading the broadcaster’s pre-match coverage while pitchside at St Mary’s when she stumbled forwards, with pundits Ian Wright and Anita Asante moving quickly to catch her as she fell. Woods later posted on her Instagram story: “Gosh that was a bit weird. Sorry to worry everyone, I’m OK, the wonderful paramedics at Saints have said it’s probably a virus, just need a bit of rest & hydration. “I’m really embarrassed that happened on tv, but a big thank you to my colleagues at ITV who have really looked after me tonight. And to Wrighty and Neets for catching me and sorry again.” What’s on today? Premier League leaders Arsenal welcome Brentford, fourth-placed Aston Villa travel to fifth-spotted Brighton, while Chelsea visit Leeds and Liverpool host Sunderland. Celtic and Rangers are also in action in the Scottish Premiership.",

            "content": "“I can’t forecast that. I don’t want to give up operations, but I can tell you that Secretary Noem is all over it,” Homan responded when asked about when the ICE surge would come. He said that ICE, Customs and Border Protection, the FBI, DEA, and ATF would all be involved. “President Trump’s been a genius on this. He brings all the government to these operations. So if we arrest an alien with drugs, you got the DEA right there, who can prosecute the case before we deport them. If you get them with a gun, you get ATF right there, and prosecute the case before we deport them. Homan stressed again that he couldn’t give exact dates, but hinted that some personnel were already on the ground. “I can tell you, the focus is there. It’s coming, but I don’t want to give a lot. I can’t tell you how many people are on the ground now, and how many people are going to be on the ground. I’ll leave that to the Secretary of Homeland Security, but focus is on those Twin Cities more because of the criminal activities there that’ve been uncovered by DOJ and DHS,” he concluded. Trump has set his sights on illegal Somali immigrants The president vented about the community and Somalia in general in a Tuesday cabinet meeting. “And when you look at what he’s done with Somalia, with Somalia, which is barely a country, you know . they have nothing. They just run around killing each other. There’s no structure,” he said. “And when I see somebody like Ilhan Omar, who I don’t know at all, but I always watch her. For years, I’ve watched her complain about our Constitution.” Minneapolis officials have reacted with hostility, pledging not to cooperate with the Trump administration in any immigration enforcement operations. At a Tuesday press conference outlining how the city would respond to the operation, Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara called on locals to call 911 on anyone wearing a mask trying to detain individuals. ICE and other immigration enforcement officers are known to wear masks to protect themselves and family members against harassment. “We have experienced reports in this city . where people call to say that there’s folks that are masked, that they’re not sure if they’re law enforcement, that they may be kidnapping people. We have had those reports,” he said. “I want to be clear to the community the community should know that if you see something like that, that that is legitimate, that you don’t know if someone is law enforcement, you should call 911, and you should provide as much information as possible.” The police chief then went a step further, arguing that police should intervene even in cases where they believe the rights of the targeted individual are being violated. “So if there is anything that is, you know, a violation of someone’s human rights or civil rights, excessive force or anything like that, they absolutely have a duty to intervene as police officers,” O’Hara concluded. Homan was livid over O’Hara’s comments, calling on him to resign in his Fox News appearance. “Shame on you. I mean, your number one responsibility is the safety and security of your communities, and ICE is targeting criminals. Criminals! So, for you not to partner with ICE to make your community safer is shameful. He ought to put his badge in the desk drawer and walk away,” he said, adding that O’Hara had stopped being a cop and had become a politician. He then threatened O’Hara with prosecution if local law enforcement tried to impede ICE operations. MINNEAPOLIS POLICE CHIEF SAYS CALL 911 ON MASKED INDIVIDUALS DETAINING PEOPLE AMID IMMIGRATION CRACKDOWN “If he wants to watch, stand aside, do it. But if you cross that line, Pam Bondi and U. S. Attorneys are waiting to prosecute anybody that impedes law enforcement. doing their job. Zero tolerance for impeding ICE in their operations,” Homan said. “We’re going to enforce the laws of this country without apology, including in the Twin Cities,” he pledged.",

            "content": "Intelligent men may be more likely to remain faithful to their partners, due to their problem-solving and pattern-spotting abilities, a new study suggests. While not exactly the most romantic of sentiments, analysis has shown that the steadiest boyfriends are more likely to be able to unpick patterns in sequences of numbers and letters. The findings come from a new study conducted by Oakland University, which analysed 202 heterosexual men who had each been in a relationship for at least six months. Researchers found that men who had a particular strain of intelligence and scored higher on specific tests often led a healthier romantic life and expressed greater commitment to their partners. They were also found to be less likely to display jealousy, insult their partners and resort to “mate-retention” tactics, controlling behaviours that make it costly for a lover to leave the relationship. It was found that these men tended to be less tempted by risk-taking outside of their relationship, and were less likely to report erectile disfunction problems and fewer psychopathic tendencies. While the authors of the research have been careful not to oversell the results, given that it did not measure cheating directly, it suggests that men of a particular intelligence have a psychological profile more compatible with remaining faithful. Led by the data analyst and social scientist Gavin Vance, the study has been published in the journal Personality and Individual Differences, with the team behind it suggesting the results are worth following up with further analysis. They have stressed that the findings of the report are modest and cannot prove cause and effect, with the results relying on what the men said about their own behaviour. A similar study published earlier this year by the University of Sydney similarly found that that couples in which male partners exhibit high emotional intelligence experience greater satisfaction, deeper trust and better conflict resolution. In the murky world of online dating and appearance-based apps, this could be an indication that intelligence could be the way forward to a happy, healthy relationship.",

            "content": "YouTube has officially launched its inaugural Recap feature. While the video platform has offered users a music and video gaming recap similar to Spotify Wrapped for the past three years, it has now revamped the feature to include broader insights into an entire watch history over the past year. “YouTube Recap uniquely highlights interests, deep dives, and moments you explored this year, based on your watch history,” the Google-owned company said Tuesday in a press release. “You’ll get a set of up to 12 different cards that spotlight your top channels, interests, and even the evolution of your viewing habits, or which personality type you fall into based on the videos you loved to watch!” Available now for North American users, YouTube Recap will roll out to the rest of the world this week. Here’s how to find your 2025 YouTube Recap. Where can I find my YouTube Recap? To locate your personalized YouTube Recap on the app or website, you must be signed in to your YouTube account. From there, tap on the “You” tab. Just below your profile details, you will find a banner button indicating that “Your Recap is here.” If the banner is not there, you can access your Recap from a browser at youtube. com/Recap. Can anyone access their YouTube Recap? You must meet certain eligibility requirements to be included in the YouTube Recap. Children under the age of 13 (or below the age requirement in your country) are ineligible, as are supervised accounts. It’s also important to note that if your watch history was paused or if you had auto-delete settings enabled, it will not count. What is a YouTube Recap? According to YouTube, the Recap feature has been highly requested among users. It goes beyond a simple rundown of the music you’ve listened to over the past year, providing a more comprehensive summary of your video viewing preferences. So whether you watched a lot of baking videos, unboxing reveals, or daily vlogs, the Recap will categorize you into one of at least 11 personality types. For example, if you’ve watched a lot of content to help develop skills, you might earn the Skill Builder personality. Or if you’re drawn to videos that spread positivity, you’ll likely be labeled the Sunshiner. “After digging into how we all watch YouTube, we didn’t just see data we saw personalities, from the Adventurer or Skill Builder, to the Creative Spirit, and so many more,” the company added in the press release. “And here’s a fun discovery: the most common personalities were the Sunshiner, the Wonder Seeker, and the Connector, with the Philosopher and the Dreamer ending up as the more elusive and rare personas.” Can I still access my YouTube Music Recap? Yes. If you’ve listened to at least 10 hours of music on YouTube, the main Recap will end on a card, sharing how many minutes of music you listened to. It will also include a link, directing you to a more personalized deep dive into your year in music. Alongside its new Recap feature, YouTube also released its popular “End of the Year” lists for 2025.

Jennifer Job was officially sworn in Tuesday night to fill the District 8 seat previously held by Lindsay Mahaffey, who resigned in August to spend more time with her family. Job, who has a doctorate in education, will serve on the board through at least 2028. Job has spent much of her career in education, including work as a teacher education professor at Oklahoma State University and teaching in the Chapel Hill-Carrboro district. She said some of her early priorities on the board will include strengthening special education services, closing the achievement gap, and developing an AI framework to help students and teachers adapt to new technology. Job said her daughter is one of her biggest motivations for serving. \"Hannah goes to an elementary school in Wake County, and so it's more important to me than ever that the kids are well represented, the teachers are well represented, and that we're, you know, we're doing the best we can,\" she said. Job participated in her first meeting shortly after the ceremony.",
